smuggling in a 30,000 acre area that was formerly a hotbed for trafficking operations prior to the soldiers\u2019 deployment. roughly a dozen tacp airmen were responsible for capturing more than 350 illegal immigrants, 34 human smugglers, and more than 800 lbs. of marijuana during a three-month span. the soldiers had to work through limited cell reception in the area that impeded their ability to communicate among themselves and relay tactical information to mission partners, border patrol, and dps. using cutting-edge technology from the texas military department, airmen were able to create their own communication network incorporating satellites. this allowed soldiers and law enforcement partners to coordinate and respond to illegal activity along the border within minutes. \"what these

continuing to work together to secure the border; stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into texas; and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal behavior between ports of entry. since the launch of operation lone star, the multi-agency effort has led to over 328,000 migrant apprehensions and more than 22,100 criminal arrests, with more than 19,600 felony charges reported. in the fight against fentanyl, dps has seized over 353 million lethal doses of fentanyl during this border mission. texas has also bused almost 8,400 migrants to our nation's capital since april, over 4,000 migrants to new york city since august 5, more than 1,300 migrants to chicago since august 31, and more than 210 migrants to philadelphia since november 15. operation lone star continues to fill the dangerous gaps left by the biden administration's refusal to secure the border. every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have

burden so many innocent texans and americans across the country,\" said governor abbott. during a press conference following the tour, governor abbott\u00a0detailed the decisive actions taken by the state of texas to combat the growing national fentanyl crisis, including\u00a0designating mexican drug cartels as a terrorist organizations, signing legislation into law that makes it a felony to make or distribute fentanyl, and launching the \"one pill kills\" campaign to raise awareness of this deadly drug across the state. texas national guard deploys armored personnel carriers to southern
