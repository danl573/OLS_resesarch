embrace the innumerable contributions made by african-americans to our society.\u00a0 having faced the trials of slavery, segregation, oppression, and the deep-rooted adversity which threatened their demands for equality and change, the achievements and perspectives of african-americans are imbued with a unique strength and resilience that are highly respected and greatly valued in the lone star

african-americans\u2014known as buffalo soldiers\u2014served our nation with distinction, overcoming both harsh conditions and prejudice to help chart the texas frontier.\u00a0 bessie coleman was born to a family of sharecroppers in atlanta, texas, and would inspire people all over the world by shattering long-held stereotypes as the first african-american to earn a pilot license.\u00a0 barbara

representatives.\u00a0 wallace jefferson, of san antonio, twice made history as the first african-american justice on the texas supreme court and later as the court\u2019s first african-american chief justice.\u00a0 american heroes and texas legend doris (dorie) miller and richard overton stand out among the best and brightest of america\u2019s greatest generation who selflessly served their country in world war ii: miller received the navy cross for his heroic actions during the attack on pearl harbor, and overton became the longest-living veteran of the war.\u00a0 these outstanding men and women, along with countless other members of the african-american community, have exemplified the indomitable spirit that truly represents the very best of the lone star state. from the founding of texas up to the present day, there is simply not a facet of life that has not been shaped in some way by the contributions of african-americans.\u00a0 each year, february is dedicated as black history month to remember and learn from the tribulations faced by the african-american community, while also celebrating their many invaluable accomplishments.\u00a0 at this time, i encourage all texans to take pride in and discover more about the strength that stems from our diversity. therefore, i, greg abbott, governor of texas, do hereby proclaim february 2022 to be black history month in
