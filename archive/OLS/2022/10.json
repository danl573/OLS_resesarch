interdict transnational criminal behavior between ports of entry. since the launch of operation lone star, the multi-agency effort has led to over 319,000 migrant apprehensions and more than 21,000 criminal arrests, with more than 18,700 felony charges reported. in the fight against fentanyl, dps has seized over 346 million lethal doses of fentanyl during this border mission. texas has also bused over 8,200 migrants to our nation's capital since april, over 3,400 migrants to new york city since august 5, and more than 1,100 migrants to chicago since august 31. the busing mission is providing much-needed relief to our overwhelmed border communities. operation lone star continues to fill the dangerous gaps left by the biden administration's refusal to secure the border. every

policies. recent highlights from operation lone star: watch: dps lt. olivarez discusses record number of migrant deaths at border dps lt. chris olivarez joined national border patrol council president brandon judd in a discussion with fox news about the record number of migrant deaths at the southern border. despite president biden claiming his open border policies are humane, a record 856 migrant deaths were reported in fiscal year 2022\u2014more than double the record previous to his administration and outpacing the record set in fiscal year 2021. \u201c[the federal government] has failed to acknowledge the fact that we have a border crisis and has failed to acknowledge that not only americans are dying [from fentanyl] but also migrants,\u201d said lt. olivarez. \u201ceverything we have been doing since last year with operation lone star has been state funded, and we have not received any support or funding from the federal government. they need to acknowledge we have a crisis at our

of dps are on the frontlines of this crisis, trying to stop the criminals, the gotaways, and the drugs that are coming across our ports of entry. it\u2019s very important that governor abbott launched

agencies to keep texans safe from the deadly opioid flooding across the border from mexico. \u201c[dps\u2019] main focus has been on the criminal activity, the flow of drugs and human smuggling cases,\u201d said lt. olivarez. \u201caside from the enforcement of anti-fentanyl measures, the most important thing is education and awareness. especially as halloween approaches, we\u2019re seeing

increase in illegal border crossings in the el paso region. soldiers contributed the techniques and equipment for detecting illegal crossings developed and refined over the course of the border mission. the el paso region\u2019s surge in illegal activity can be traced to mass migration from south america, according to dps el paso regional director jose sanchez. the el paso region also has two major arteries into the interior of the u.s., making it a particularly desirable crossing for drug smugglers and human traffickers.\u00a0 \u201c[the soldiers] do anything we ask,\u201d said dps

terrorists in an op-ed for the el paso times, governor abbott explains the significance of his recent designation of mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations and why president biden must take action to confront the dangers these transnational criminal organizations pose to texans across the state, as well as the whole nation. \"president biden has already declared the cartel-driven fentanyl and opioid crisis a national emergency on paper but is doing little to solve it in practice,\" wrote governor abbott. \"if our nation\u2019s leaders truly care about ensuring americans\u2019 safety, president biden will declare mexican drug cartels foreign terrorist organizations, as texas already has, and take actions to mitigate against increasingly deadly cartel threats surging across our border.\" a federal designation of mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations would freeze cartel assets, weakening the financial support of trafficking activities. federal investigators and prosecutors could also aggressively pursue the enhanced criminal sentences applicable to drug traffickers who fund foreign terrorist organizations. additionally, designating cartels as federal terrorist organizations would heighten public awareness, while signaling to the international community that america will not tolerate terrorists who poison its citizens. read governor
