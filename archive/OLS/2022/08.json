nation because of the dangerous gaps left by the biden administration's refusal to secure the border.\u00a0with the help of texans across the state, we can bring criminals to justice, destroy their illegal enterprises, and keep our communities safe.\" since governor abbott launched operation lone star in march 2021, dps troopers have uncovered more than 170 stash houses, which has led to the
