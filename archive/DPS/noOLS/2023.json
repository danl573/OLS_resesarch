thursday, feb. 16, at dps headquarters in austin.  \u201cit\u2019s important to take the time to recognize the critical, and often lifesaving, actions of these individuals,\u201d said dps director steven mccraw. \u201cthese are the people who\u00a0make the department so tremendous, and we are proud to be able to honor their hard work, commitment and dedication to service that make texas a safer place for all of us to call home.\u201d the following individuals were recognized: sergeant scott hewitt, texas highway patrol \u2013 headquarters, was awarded a medal of merit. since 2015, sergeant hewitt has been a member of the state crash reconstruction team. he is also responsible for reviewing each dps fleet crash and is a core instructor of the transportation code. as a texas highway patrol (thp) trooper, he identified the need for uniformed enforcement of the texas transportation code and proper application of contributing factors by law enforcement in crash investigations throughout the state. the volume and scope of these topics can make it difficult for officers to understand and accurately apply them to real world scenarios. undertaking the monumental task to create and develop a user-friendly resource to assist with uniform interpretation and application of the transportation code, sgt. hewitt created a 278-page document titled \u201cfield enforcement guidance,\u201d which contains a listing of commonly utilized transportation code arrest titles. he went on to create an additional 130-page document titled \u201ccontributing factors in crash investigation guidance\u201d to assist officers with the uniform application and use of contributing factors in crash reporting and directly correlated each of these back to the transportation code guide. this guide addresses every possible contributing factor which could be present in a crash, along with examples, diagrams, and explanations of their use or their non-applicability under certain conditions. sergeant hewitt is also responsible for authoring a corresponding eight-hour texas commission on law enforcement (tcole) accredited course of instruction, which has been presented to thousands of texas law enforcement officers through thp in-service, first line supervisor training, crash special topics courses and to numerous other texas police agencies. we thank him for this tireless, forward-thinking and dedicated efforts that are directly in line with the finest traditions of this department.  sergeant roy lytle, training operations division \u2013 headquarters, trooper joshua delagarza, texas highway patrol \u2013 capitol bike patrol, and trooper antonio rico, texas highway patrol \u2013 capitol bike patrol, each received a lifesaving award for their actions on dec. 14, 2022.\u00a0  while attending a dps fitness unit workout in a state parking garage, a state employee suffered a medical emergency. sergeant lytle assessed the subject, determined he was having a seizure and rolled him onto his side. another class participant called for help and troopers delagarza and rico responded. as they arrived, the subject stopped breathing and no longer had a pulse. sergeant lytle rolled the subject onto his back and secured aed pads in order to analyze the subject\u2019s heart function. he then used the aed to administer a shock, trooper rico began cpr compressions, while trooper delagarza coordinated with ems and prepared his dps unit to transport the patient if necessary. trooper rico continued chest compressions until the subject began breathing on his own and they detected a faint pulse. trooper delagarza directed austin/travis county ems to the location, and upon arrival, ems personnel took charge of medical treatment and transported the patient to the hospital where he was monitored and analyzed. due to their decisive and professional response to a life-threatening situation the patient survived. please join us in congratulating all

does, but we\u2019re even prouder to be able to share this critical training with other agencies and law enforcement personnel across the country. we are confident more children, in more communities will be saved because of it.\u201d in the last year, dps\u2019 ipc personnel have traveled to seven states and canada to get this valuable training into more areas. in 2022, the department has given 19 ipc basic classes and trained a total of 709 students. personnel have attended 22 conferences and briefings to present to more than 1,800 people.  here are some additional 2022 highlights: ipc training has resulted in the rescues of thousands of trafficking victims and the opening of hundreds of criminal investigations. since its inception, in texas alone, over 500 children have been rescued and over 300 criminal investigations have been initiated. more about ipc  dps developed the ipc program to help front line law enforcement officers identify and rescue endangered or exploited children and identify those who pose a high-risk threat to a child. while law enforcement officers are well-trained and highly proficient in making observations of suspicious behaviors leading to arrests and successful interdictions of illicit drugs, weapons, and currency, this program works to expand their training and knowledge so they can take a victim-centered approach in working child victimization cases and identifying those who offend against children.  ipc is a comprehensive training course covering topics from understanding victims and offenders, legal issues and authority, working with children, the officer\u2019s role to understanding indicators, intelligence reporting as well as identifying and working with local/state resources such as child and victim services.  as of december 2022, ipc has trained more than 12,000 law enforcement officers and child service professionals in over 30 states, u.s. territories and tribal nations.\u00a0the program\u2019s core message

the use of force, fraud or coercion in any type of labor exploitation or commercial sex act, or when an individual under the age of 18 is involved in commercial sex - can happen to anyone, anywhere. it occurs in every state, every day and often goes unnoticed by those in the community. to draw attention to those victims, the texas department of public safety (dps) is reminding texans to be vigilant as we mark national human trafficking prevention month. \u201chuman traffickers are a serious threat to the safety of our communities, and it is up to all of us to be aware to stop the cycle,\u201d said dps director steven mccraw. \u201cby being alert and notifying law enforcement of something that doesn\u2019t seem right, you can help someone from a situation in which they are unable to help themselves.\u201d dps\u2019 human trafficking program is charged with the overall direction of the state\u2019s enforcement efforts against human trafficking in texas. the program works with local, state and federal agencies within texas and the nation to identify, investigate, disrupt and/or dismantle major human trafficking organizations.  public awareness is an important part of preventing and combating this crime. human trafficking operations are often masked as legitimate businesses in highly visible areas and victims can be lured from suburban areas, rural areas or big cities. traffickers tend to prey on the vulnerabilities of high-risk populations like those experiencing homelessness, juvenile runaways, historical or active drug users, individuals with difficult or abusive homes and individuals with language barriers or a reason to want to avoid law enforcement personnel. no matter how it happens, human trafficking has devastating impacts on victims and our communities.  this month, and always, dps asks texans to be observant of others around you and take note of the following possible indicators of human trafficking: the presence of an indicator does not confirm an occurrence of human trafficking; however, the combination and context of indicators may indicate human trafficking pending law enforcement investigation and you are encouraged to report it. if you see signs of human trafficking, call 911 immediately to report it and be ready to give as many details as possible. you can also make a report on iwatchtexas or call the national human trafficking hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or text \u201cbefree\u201d to 233733. remember do not endanger yourself or others by intervening or confronting someone you suspect of engaging in human trafficking if it is not safe to do so.  ###\u00a0(hq 2023-004)  @txdps @txdps \u00a0 txdeptpublicsafety texas dps mobile app phone: (512) 424-2080 email: media@dps.texas.gov general inquiries: visit
