board a bus or flight, a migrant must volunteer to be transported and show documentation from dhs. mayors and county judges can notify tdem of any dhs-facilitated drop-off of migrants in their communities so that the agency can provide appropriate transportation. governor abbott has also directed dps to conduct enhanced safety inspections of vehicles as they cross international ports of entry into texas. this directive, which is effective immediately, anticipates a significant rise in cartel-facilitated smuggling via unsafe vehicles upon the end of title 42 expulsions.\u00a0 governor

after president biden announced that his administration will end title 42 expulsions despite the united states seeing historically high numbers of illegal border crossings: \"president biden\u2019s open-border policies are an unmitigated disaster for national security. his recklessness has forced the state of texas to take unprecedented steps to fill the gaps\u2014including deploying texas department of public safety troopers and over 10,000 texas national guard soldiers, jailing illegal immigrants who are charged with trespassing, and becoming the first state ever to build a wall to secure the border. \"instead of listening to the millions of americans that his administration has endangered\u2014and instead of enforcing immigration laws passed by congress\u2014president biden has chosen to jeopardize the safety and security of those very americans he swore to protect and defend by ending title 42 expulsions. \u00a0 \"ending title 42 expulsions will signal to cartels and migrants alike that our southern border is now wide open\u2014inciting even more violence, more trafficking, and more lawlessness. president biden clearly has no intention to secure the border by faithfully executing congress\u2019 command to detain and deport illegal immigrants. his actions will only further endanger texans, and the state of texas must take even more unprecedented action to keep our communities safe by using any and all constitutional powers to protect its own territory.\" p.o. box 12428\naustin texas 78711\n(512) 463-2000", "governor abbott appoints coorsh to texas
