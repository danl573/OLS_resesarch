to end 2022 safely as they travel and spend time with family and friends this holiday season. the texas highway patrol will conduct its annual christmas and new year\u2019s holiday traffic enforcement campaign beginning dec. 23 and will be out on the roads looking for people who are speeding, not wearing their seat belts, driving while intoxicated or committing other traffic violations. additionally, this year dps is reminding everyone to be watchful of their surroundings and to report any suspicious activity you may see through iwatchtexas \u201cwe wish everyone a safe and happy holiday,\u201d said dps director steven mccraw. \u201cwhether you\u2019re staying local to end the year or traveling, we encourage everyone to make safety their number one priority by following a few tips that will help make our roads and celebrations safer for everyone.\u201d the texas highway patrol will increase enforcement as part operation care (crash awareness and reduction effort), which runs nationwide from dec. 23 through jan. 2. during dps\u2019 2021 christmas and new year\u2019s enforcement efforts, there were more than 91,000 citations and warnings issued. this included 30,291 speeding warnings/citations; 2,780 seat belt and child seat violations; 1,881 citations for driving without insurance; and 456 citations and warnings for move over, slow down violations.  dps offers the following safety tips for the upcoming holiday season: the iwatchtexas program is a critical resource for reporting suspicious activity in communities in order to help prevent dangerous attacks as we bring 2022 to a close. everyone is urged to download the free ios or android mobile app if you haven\u2019t done so already. tips can be reported via the website, the mobile app or by calling 844-643-2251. reports may be submitted confidentially. for information on how to use iwatchtexas, you can view this how-to video.  remember, iwatchtexas is not for emergencies. if there is an emergency, call 911 immediately.  dps is also asking travelers to be on the lookout for possible human trafficking this holiday season. an increase in people on the road and at airports means there is an increased opportunity for the community to spot potential human trafficking activities and report it to law enforcement. this can save lives! if you are traveling, be observant of others around you and take note of the following indicators of human trafficking: the person appears to be under control of another person either physically (someone else controls the person\u2019s possessions i.e., id, money, phone) or psychologically (little to no eye contact, unable to speak for themselves or unable to make simple decisions without approval). the presence of an indicator does not confirm an occurrence of human trafficking; however, the combination and context of indicators may indicate human trafficking pending law enforcement investigation and you are encouraged to report it. if you see signs of human trafficking while traveling for the holidays, call 911 immediately to report it and be ready to give as many details as possible. you can also make a report on iwatchtexas or call the national human trafficking hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or text \u201cbefree\u201d to 233733. remember do not endanger yourself or others by intervening or confronting someone you suspect of engaging in human trafficking if it is not safe to do so. ###\u00a0(hq 2022-085)  @txdps @txdps \u00a0 txdeptpublicsafety texas dps mobile app phone: (512) 424-2080 email: media@dps.texas.gov general inquiries:

individuals were recognized: trooper jose h. gonzalez, texas highway patrol \u2014 harlingen, received a lifesaving award for his decisive and professional response to a life-threatening situation on nov. 1, 2021. on that day, trooper gonzalez responded to a scene at an intersection in starr county to assist with a baby who was not breathing. upon arrival, he began assisting trooper nathan crow, who had already arrived, with administering additional strikes on the baby\u2019s upper torso and clearing the mouth and nose. once the baby began to breathe, trooper gonzalez, who is also an emt, retrieved his medical equipment and began monitoring the baby\u2019s respirations. ems personnel arrived on scene, and after a short while, the baby recovered. special agent william alston, criminal investigations division (cid) \u2014 mount pleasant, received a lifesaving award for his quick actions on july 21, 2022. special agents william alston and nisha thompson were surveilling the rio grande river when they observed a group of ten undocumented immigrants attempting to cross. the group was comprised of adults, an infant and two young children being carried by their respective mothers. as the group crossed, several people were swept downriver. special agents alston and thompson attempted to throw rescue ropes but were unsuccessful. one of the mothers then dropped the two-year-old child who subsequently went under water. special agent alston grabbed a flotation device, jumped into the river, swam approximately thirty-five yards and recovered the child. he then noticed the other child was also drowning and was able to save that child as well. once the children were safe, alston gave the flotation device to the adults in the group who were also struggling. once out of the water, both children were medically evaluated, and it was determined that both were uninjured. trooper james glaze, texas highway patrol \u2014 plano, received a lifesaving award for his response to a life-threatening situation on feb. 22, 2022. trooper glaze was traveling on ih-20 when he stopped to assist what he believed to be a stranded motorist. he then discovered the driver was clearly in distress and unable to communicate. trooper glaze detected an unusual odor, which he recognized to be a sign of someone experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis, a possible life-threatening medical crisis. after calling for an ambulance, glaze retrieved his medic bag and administered oral glucose. the driver slowly showed signs of improvement; however, the crisis was not fully averted. as fire department personnel arrived on scene and assumed medical care, paramedics determined he was experiencing a diabetic stroke and immediately transported the subject to a local hospital for further medical treatment.  trooper sean hazel, texas highway patrol \u2014 midland, received a lifesaving award for his swift response at the scene of a crash on feb. 20, 2022. that day, trooper hazel observed a motorcyclist driving in a reckless manner and initiated a traffic stop. a vehicle pursuit ensued for several miles before the rider entered a construction area, drove into the center median and crashed after striking construction supplies. trooper hazel immediately ran to the rider and discovered that he was not breathing and unresponsive. without hesitation, hazel began performing chest compressions, while attempting to communicate with the subject. after approximately three minutes, the driver began to breathe on his own; however, he stopped breathing again. trooper hazel continued cpr efforts, and the subject was resuscitated. ems personnel arrived on the scene, and the rider was transported to a local hospital where he was treated for numerous broken bones and lacerations. trooper michael lueck, texas highway patrol \u2014 capitol, received two lifesaving awards for his heroic actions during two separate incidents. the first took place on nov. 6, 2021, when trooper lueck responded to a report of an altercation that led to shots being fired at wolf ranch in georgetown. early information suggested one person had been shot in the chest. when trooper lueck arrived on scene, georgetown police officers had secured the weapon and were handcuffing the suspect. trooper lueck grabbed his medical trauma kit and began rendering first aid to the gunshot victim by applying a hyfin chest seal to the entry wound. he moved the victim onto his side and applied a second chest seal to the exit wound on the victim\u2019s back. during his assessment, trooper lueck determined the victim was in shock, and his condition was deteriorating. ems personnel arrived on the scene and transported the victim to a local hospital for additional treatment. trooper lueck\u2019s second lifesaving award is for his actions during an incident on may 18, 2022, when trooper lueck heard a call of \u201cshots fired\u201d over the radio and immediately traveled to the scene. upon arrival, he observed officers taking cover behind two police vehicles and a black passenger vehicle with multiple bullet holes. after joining the officers behind the patrol units, trooper joseph mansion began giving verbal commands to the driver of the vehicle over the loudspeaker. a male subject crawled out of the driver\u2019s seat onto the ground, at which time trooper lueck noticed he was bleeding from his legs and torso. he also observed the subject was unarmed, so he put away his patrol rifle, retrieved his medical bag and advised officers that he, under their cover, would retrieve the subject and provide medical aid. troopers lueck and mansion retrieved the subject and moved him behind the patrol vehicles. trooper lueck then identified two gunshot wounds to the upper left chest, multiple gunshots to his legs and a gunshot wound to his back. he applied chest seals to each of the wounds on his torso and a tourniquet to the left leg to control the bleeding. as ems personnel arrived on scene, trooper lueck continued providing care to the subject while briefing them on the injuries. the subject was transported to a local hospital for additional medical treatment and was booked into the williamson county jail on multiple charges two days later.  trooper ethan mcadoo, texas highway patrol \u2014 new caney, was awarded a lifesaving award for his actions at a crash scene on june 19, 2022. trooper mcadoo was dispatched to a two-vehicle head-on crash in new caney that day. he was the only first responder on the scene when he arrived. as he made contact with the driver of one of the vehicles, mcadoo observed severe injuries to both legs. his right leg had massive injuries, and he was losing a large amount of blood. trooper mcadoo retrieved his tourniquet; however, while trying to apply it, the tourniquet broke. mcadoo continued to use the tourniquet and make it as tight as possible to slow the loss of blood. when ems personnel arrived on scene, trooper mcadoo obtained and applied a second tourniquet and successfully stopped the bleeding. ems personnel assumed primary care of the patient, and he was transported to a local hospital for further medical treatment. he was later released and is receiving physical therapy to regain full use of his leg. trooper brian barnes, texas highway patrol \u2014 nacogdoches, received a lifesaving award, and deputy ron wherry, nacogdoches county sheriff\u2019s office received a director\u2019s award, for their quick thinking and heroic actions on july 9, 2022. trooper barnes responded to an emergency broadcast of an unconscious child found submerged in a rural pond. as the first responder on the scene, barnes discovered a lifeless five-year-old. upon assessing the child\u2019s condition, trooper barnes began administering cpr. nacogdoches county sheriff\u2019s deputy ron wherry was the second responder on the scene and immediately began assisting trooper barnes in cpr efforts. both officers remained calm and focused under extreme conditions during the chaotic situation. after approximately two minutes, the child was revived. trooper barnes and deputy wherry continued to provide aid to the child until emergency medical services personnel arrived on the scene to take control. steven taylor was awarded a director\u2019s award for his brave actions on july 30, 2021, in leon county. mr. taylor drove upon the scene of a major accident on us highway 79 where a motorcycle had struck a pickup truck towing a horse trailer. mr. taylor arrived on the scene prior to any police, fire or ems personnel. as a former combat medic in the united states army, mr. taylor exited his vehicle and began assessing the scene and those involved. mr. taylor observed the motorcyclist\u2019s leg had been amputated below the knee, and he was lying on the roadway, rapidly losing blood. mr. taylor utilized his training and experience to create a makeshift tourniquet using a belt, which he applied to the uppermost portion of the subject\u2019s leg. mr. taylor continued to care for the subject and remained in constant communication with emergency service dispatchers, relaying accurate updates until ems personnel arrived on the scene. once ems personnel arrived, the subject was transported via helicopter to a hospital where he received extensive medical treatment. members of the criminal investigations division (cid) southeast texas region received a unit citation for their work in combating drug trafficking across the country. in 2019, dps\u2019 cid methamphetamine initiative group (mig) initiated a joint state and federal investigation into the tran drug trafficking organization (dto), which was responsible for the distribution of several hundred kilograms of fentanyl and methamphetamine, including counterfeit pills in texas, louisiana, oklahoma, illinois and georgia, by means of numerous clandestine laboratories in the greater houston area.  the investigation, dubbed \u201ctoretto's nightmare,\u201d generated additional investigations in multiple states. criminal and financial analysts from dps\u2019 mig and intelligence and counterterrorism division, dea, fbi and irs collaborated to identify multiple members of the organization and provide investigative support, which resulted in asset seizures totaling more than $1.5 million. additionally, officers arrested 13 defendants, seized 19 firearms and seven vehicles. of note, during a single operation, officers seized a clandestine lab resulting in the confiscation of 124 kilograms of methamphetamine and 274 kilograms of fentanyl with an estimated street value of more than $12 million. this was confirmed by the dea as the largest single seizure of fentanyl in u.s. history. the tran dto was dismantled in november 2019. all cases are currently pending, with each defendant facing a minimum of 10 years in federal prison. intelligence and counterterrorism division (ict) analysts hannah robinson and adam unnasch, both assigned to the texas ten most wanted program, were recently recognized by the texas crime stoppers office and presented with letters of recognition by governor greg abbott for their role in making 2021 the most successful year in the texas ten most wanted program\u2019s 30-year history.  working collaboratively with dps\u2019 criminal investigations division, robinson and unnasch provided critical information and analysis to help law enforcement partners around the state and nation capture 34 of texas\u2019 most wanted fugitives in 2021. this breaks the previous record of 32 arrests set in 2013. through their tremendous work in the texas ten most wanted program, these analysts helped law enforcement protect and serve their communities by getting wanted criminals off the streets. governor abbott\u2019s letters concluded by stating, \u201cyour work has made texas communities safer, and as such, you represent the best of the lone star state.\u201d  we congratulate all

after the crime, the texas rangers unsolved crimes investigation program (ucip) has helped secure a conviction in the 1988 killing of patricia ann howell jacobs.  on sept. 20, 2022, daniel andrew macginnis entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to serve 20 years for her murder. that sentence will run concurrently with a previous 199-year sentence on unrelated drug and weapons charges in tyler county.  back on oct. 6, 1988, jacobs\u2019 body was found in the neches river in port arthur, texas. she was last seen the previous evening at the silver spur nightclub in silsbee. a month later, her driver license and other personal items were located under a bridge near kountze, texas. investigators identified macginnis as a suspect after two other incidents involving women but did not have enough evidence to charge him in jacobs\u2019 case. then, in 2018, jacobs\u2019 family reached out to the texas rangers ucip. the rangers believed further investigation was needed and officially reopened the case in october 2018. through the new investigation, clothing that had never been dna-tested and other items were identified and the evidence was submitted to the houston dps crime lab for testing and retesting. the new dna evidence was then entered into the combined dna indexing system (codis), which identified a \u201chit\u201d on macginnis. after an interview and confirmation of the dna evidence, he was arrested and eventually charged with jacobs\u2019 murder in jefferson county. during the murder trial, macginnis entered a guilty plea and it was accepted.  the texas rangers would like to thank the port arthur police department for assisting in this investigation and helping bring justice for patricia ann howell jacobs, as well as the jefferson county district attorney's office for their hard work and prosecution of this case. the texas ranger unsolved crimes investigation program was created to assist texas law enforcement agencies investigating unsolved homicides or violent serial crimes. since there is no statute of limitations on the offense of murder, investigators pursue these cases to a successful resolution or until no viable leads remain. the texas rangers\u2019 cold case website provides information on more than 125 cases in an effort to garner public interest in unsolved or cold cases. texas crime stoppers offers rewards (funded by the governor\u2019s criminal justice division and administered by dps) of up to $3,000 for information that leads to the arrest of those responsible for any ranger cold case listed on the website. for

safety (dps) partnered with the choctaw nation of oklahoma to offer a two-day interdiction for the protection of children (ipc) program. ipc is a human trafficking and crimes against children class that trains front-line officers to recognize indicators that a child may be a victim, at risk of victimization or missing.  \u201cthe ipc program is proven to help save the lives of children,\u201d said dps director steven mccraw. \u201cdps is honored to partner with the choctaw nation of oklahoma to offer this training to an entirely new group of law enforcement officers who will now have the tools and training to step in and take action for children who need help.\u201d representatives from two dozen agencies took part in the training which was held at the choctaw casino & resort conference center, including the choctaw nation department of criminal justice and choctaw nation tribal police. \"to be able to start a partnership with texas dps, with their training knowledge and skill set to pass it along and network with oklahoma law enforcement \u2013 especially tribal police \u2013 is vital,\u201d said choctaw tribal police chief jesse petty.  during the training, dps major derek prestridge presented choctaw tribal police with a texas state flag which had flown over the texas capitol to commemorate the partnership between the two law enforcement agencies in the protection of children and interdiction of human trafficking.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cwe are so thankful for all these groups coming together and taking the lead from the texas dps,\u201d said gary batton, chief of the choctaw nation. \u201cwe are the first tribal nation to ever partner with anyone to provide this type of training, education and awareness,\"\u00a0added batton. this important training was made possible through a grant from the office of community oriented policing services (cops) - the component of the u.s. department of justice responsible for advancing the practice of community policing by the nation\u2019s state, local, territorial and tribal law enforcement agencies through information and grant resources. the texas dps cops grant objective is to develop and exchange practice-based innovation in community policing or expand the body of data regarding effectiveness in an effort to enhance goal skills and strategies to address crime or advance public safety.  interdiction for the protection of children (ipc) program dps developed the ipc program to help front line law enforcement officers identify and rescue endangered or exploited children and identify those who pose a high-risk threat to a child. while law enforcement officers are well-trained and highly proficient in making observations of suspicious behaviors leading to arrests and successful interdictions of illicit drugs, weapons, and currency, this program works to expand their training and knowledge so they can take a victim-centered approach in working child victimization cases and identifying those who offend against children.  ipc is a comprehensive training course covering topics from understanding victims and offenders, legal issues and authority, working with children, the officer\u2019s role to understanding indicators, intelligence reporting as well as identifying and working with local/state resources such as child and victim services. the program\u2019s core message is to stop waiting for children to ask for help view photos from the two-day training on the dps facebook page. ### (hq 2022-065)  @txdps @txdps \u00a0 txdeptpublicsafety texas dps mobile app phone:

jos\u00e9 baldomero flores iii pled guilty in a bexar county courtroom in the killings of two women, heather willms and esmeralda herrera. flores, 41, was sentenced to two life sentences to run consecutively and one charge of arson. the sentencing closes a texas ranger unsolved crimes investigation program (ucip) case nearly two decades old. in february 2005, heather willms, 21, failed to show up for work as a waitress at a leon valley restaurant. she was found sexually assaulted and brutally killed inside her residence. her killer then attempted to burn her body to remove evidence. investigators identified flores, a purported friend of willms, as a possible suspect. his dna was located on willms\u2019 body, along with dna from an unknown subject. the case eventually stalled, and flores was never charged. then, in march 2011, esmeralda herrera, 30, was found dead in her san antonio apartment in a manner similar to the willms case. her apartment had also been set on fire. the san antonio police department investigated and arrested flores for the murder. however, the prosecutor in the case ruled that there was insufficient evidence for trial, and flores was released.  both cases remained cold until 2015, when the texas ranger ucip began focusing resources on the willms investigation. a case review meeting that included texas department of public safety laboratory personnel and investigators proved valuable. the rangers ultimately identified the unknown dna from willms\u2019 body and worked closely with the bexar county district attorney\u2019s office and the san antonio and leon valley police departments on these investigations. in november 2016, flores was arrested for the murders of willms and herrera, and in 2019, michael hoyle, a former bexar county assistant da, was appointed as a special prosecutor for these cases. finally, on july 25, 2022, flores was given life sentences in both cases, bringing some closure to the family and friends of these

reminding applicants for a commercial driver license (cdl) or certain endorsements that the entry level driver training (eldt) requirements begin feb. 7, 2022. recent inclement weather has closed some driver license offices; however, the federal requirement has not been delayed as a result of these closures. the federal motor carrier safety administration (fmcsa) oversees the eldt regulations, which are designed to improve highway safety by ensuring entry level drivers of commercial motor vehicles complete minimum federal training requirements before being permitted to take certain cdl tests. anyone who is either applying for a class a or class b cdl for the first time, upgrading an existing cdl to a class a or b, or obtaining a school bus (s), passenger (p) or hazardous materials (h) endorsement for the first time must meet eldt requirements. each state must electronically verify that an applicant completed the required training and certification process before administering a cdl skills test or prior to the knowledge test for an \u2018h\u2019 endorsement. commercial driving schools can become an approved eldt provider by registering with fmcsa through its training provider registry (tpr). for more information about how the federal program works, how to become a certified training registry provider and what schools are registered to provide eldt training, visit the tpr site. schedule an appointment customers wishing to obtain or upgrade to a cdl will need to book an appointment. to schedule an appointment or check availability, visit the online appointment scheduler. you must make an appointment online. upon arrival at the driver license office, customers can check-in at the kiosk inside or from their mobile device. a reminder, customers can only check-in up to 30 minutes prior to their appointment time. the department reminds customers who have existing appointments, but will not be able to keep them, to please cancel as soon as they are able. while the department is working to serve as many customers as possible, people not showing up for their appointments continues to be a major obstacle. the current no-show rate for appointments is 28%, which negatively impacts our ability to get texans the services they need. driver license offices will remain open monday through friday during normal operating hours to assist customers with both commercial and non-commercial driver license needs. appointments may be booked up to six months in advance for a specific day and time. the department has information about the eldt requirements on our website, which can be found here. ### (hq 2022-010)  @txdps @txdps \u00a0 txdeptpublicsafety texas dps mobile app phone: (512) 424-2080 email: media@dps.texas.gov general inquiries: visit the

the texas department of public safety (dps) reminds students, parents, teachers and other school administrators that the iwatchtexas program is a critical resource for reporting suspicious activity in schools and communities in order to help prevent dangerous attacks. during the 2020-21 school year, there were no school shootings in texas. by using the numerous resources available, everyone can continue working to prevent attacks by reporting any potential threats. these resources include the iwatchtexas program, the texas school safety center and, lastly, the active shooter alert, if an attack is underway.  \u201cschool safety is a top priority for dps, and iwatchtexas makes it easier for people to report anything suspicious that may indicate a potential threat,\u201d said dps director steven mccraw. \u201cwe must remain vigilant to ensure our children and teachers are safe when they head to school. if anyone sees anything suspicious, it is critical for them to report it with this user-friendly tool. it may ultimately save lives.\u201d the iwatchtexas program is a partnership between communities and law enforcement and uses citizen-sourced tips on suspicious activity to thwart potential criminal acts.  dps saw three times as many reports made through iwatchtexas in 2021 compared to 2020, as schools began going back to in-person learning. iwatchtexas is a valuable tool for school safety reporting, because it adds important threat information to the texas school safety network. dps is then able to use all of the available information to provide greater situational awareness and increase sharing between schools and law enforcement agencies, while still protecting the privacy of the student. in 2021, there were numerous instances in which reports to iwatchtexas resulted in collaboration between local, state and federal law enforcement, school districts, mental health professionals and parents or legal guardians to intervene with at-risk students and prevent possible incidents at schools. this included an incident in september 2021, when a member of the public saw social media posts involving a teen in san patricio county and made a report via iwatchtexas. dps and law enforcement agencies in san patricio county investigated the posts, which revealed the teen had killed his family and was planning an attack on his school, as well.  tips can be reported via the website, the free ios or android mobile app or by calling 844-643-2251. all reports are confidential. for information on how to use iwatchtexas, you can view this how-to video. remember, iwatchtexas is not for emergencies. if there is an emergency on a school campus or in a community, call 911 immediately. also, the program can be used to report suspicious activity in areas other than schools. in addition to iwatchtexas, the texas school safety center is another useful tool for school security. it\u2019s part of texas state university and offers valuable resources on school safety for parents and members of the school community. it\u2019s designed to be a central location for research, training and technical information for all school districts, charter schools and community colleges in the state. the texas school safety center has staff experienced in school safety and can provide technical assistance or training, conduct program evaluations or offer resources to schools. classes are also available online for the community. finally, on sept. 1, 2021, dps implemented the active shooter alert system. this is not school-specific but could be used in the event of a shooting at or near a school. the newly-implemented alert system is designed to notify people in close proximity to an active shooter situation through cell phones, local broadcast media and texas department of transportation dynamic message signs (dms), to encourage people to avoid the area or shelter-in-place. dps will issue an active shooter alert when an agency submits a request that meets the requirements. those include an active shooter in the agency\u2019s jurisdiction, determining that the alert would assist people near the active shooter\u2019s location, verification of the active shooter situation through a preliminary investigation by the requesting agency and that the shooter\u2019s last known location is identifiable. by utilizing these available resources, texans can work together to keep our schools safe. ### (hq 2022-003)  @txdps @txdps \u00a0 txdeptpublicsafety texas dps mobile app phone: (512) 424-2080 email: media@dps.texas.gov general
