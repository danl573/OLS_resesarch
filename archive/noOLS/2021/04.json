greg abbott, lieutenant governor dan patrick, and speaker dade phelan today announced the release of $11.2 billion in new federal funds to help public schools address student learning loss and costs incurred as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. these one-time funds are intended to support a comprehensive learning recovery effort in texas over the next three years. due to federal requirements, two-thirds of the funds are\u00a0available immediately under grants administered by the texas education agency (tea), with the final one-third to be\u00a0distributed\u00a0contingent upon approval\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0u.s.\u00a0department of education.\u00a0 given the complicated nature of the federal maintenance of effort requirements and the enormity of the education challenge ahead, the decision to release these new funds was reached with the important input of senate finance chair jane nelson, house appropriations chair greg bonnen, senate education chair larry taylor,

and\u00a0comes on the heels of the largest single-year increase in funding for texas public education in the history of the state. the texas legislature passed the transformative legislation\u00a0house bill 3 in 2019, and during the 2019-20 school year, state funding for public education increased by more than $5 billion from the year prior. \"the state of texas is ensuring that our public schools have the necessary resources to help texas students recover from learning loss related to covid-19,\" said governor abbott. \"two years ago, the legislature passed, and i signed historic school finance legislation to ensure education funding was more equitable and that we fund schools in part on their ability to ensure students are ready for higher education or a career. to ensure this pandemic does not become a generational education crisis, we expect, and students deserve, for this funding to be used to remediate the progress lost due to the pandemic. this will ensure that texas students will be ready to fill the jobs created in and attracted to this state.\u201d \"throughout the challenges of the pandemic over the last year, i have worked to ensure the

said lt. governor patrick.\u00a0 \"these resources will help close the gap for our students who have fallen behind as a result of covid-19,\" said speaker dade phelan. \"now more than ever, our state must work in unison to ensure our students remain competitive and have the tools they need to succeed. texas is committed to our children and our public education system, and these funds and our efforts this session will underscore that commitment.\" more funds for texas public schools will be coming soon. as part of the coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriation (crrsa) act, texas was allotted more than $5 billion in funds for public education. however, both crrsa and other legislation\u00a0passed by congress came with significant strings attached. as the texas education agency is working through these issues with the department of education, the state will continue to support school districts as they have over the past year. that includes holding the districts
