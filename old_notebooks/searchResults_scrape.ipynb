      "Key Takeaways  \n",
      " \n",
      " In 2012, small firms, defined by the Small Business Administration as those with fewer \n",
      "than 500 employees, represented 98.6% of Texas employers. A more useful definition \n",
      "may be SBF100 firms (those employing less than 100 workers) by putting more emphasis \n",
      "on the mos t entrepreneurial sector of the economy.  \n",
      " In 2012, SBF100 firms hired roughly 3 million workers and had an estimated total \n",
      "economic impact of $844 billion in gross output.  \n",
      " Of these firms, the construction ($68.8 billion), professional -scientific & technical  \n",
      "services ($68.1 billion), retail trade ($62.4 billion) and health & social services ($53.6 \n",
      "billion) sectors had the most impact.  \n",
      " SBF100 firms in 2012 generated $13.866 bill ion in state revenue and $14.97  billion in \n",
      "federal revenue.  \n",
      " Studies have shown that  SBF 100 firms provided experience and on -the-job training to a \n",
      "broader segment of the population, on average, than larger firms do.  \n",
      " Studies have also shown that children of small business owners are more likely to start \n",
      "small businesses of their own.  \n",
      " A growing portion of the workforce, known as “giggers”, have found autonomy and \n",
      "increased income by putting their higher skillsets to work in multiple temporary work \n",
      "assignments. This portion is projected to rise, placing growing importance on the need to \n",
      "understand the issues associated with it.  \n",
      " Recent studies have shown that job creation does not depend on firm size, but rather on \n",
      "firm age. In other words, newer small firms likely create more jobs (on their way to \n",
      "becoming large firms) than older small firm s. \n",
      " Rural areas in Texas, as well as the entire US, are transitioning from an agricultural and \n",
      "manufacturing -dominated economy to a more sustainable and diverse urban -rural \n",
      "interdependence model.  \n",
      " Cities with a higher concentration of creative class workers are more resilient in turbulent \n",
      "economic times, but studies point to the lack of focus on negative impacts this has on \n",
      "low-income workers dealing with higher costs of living.  \n",
      " Small business development is greatly discouraged by the lack of capital, assets,  \n",
      "information, and proper management.  5 \n",
      " Executive Summary  \n",
      "The Office of the Governo r contracted with CCBR to investigate the economic impact of Texas \n",
      "businesses with fewer than 100 employees and to identify factors that contribute to their success \n",

      "The Small Business Administration (SBA) state profile for Texas shows that in 2012 small firms \n",

      " Summary  \n",
      "The study depicts several pictures of the relationships between the relative importance of small \n",
      "establish ments in their respective industrial sectors and households’ median income across \n",
      "counties in the State of Texas. These results contribute to the research on the relationship \n",
      "between small businesses and income per capita by adding a disaggregated analysis  by industrial \n",
      "sectors and by establishment size.  \n",
      "The results indicate that in some industries the higher percentage of very small establishments is \n",
      "positively related to higher incomes. However , in other industries this relationship is reversed:  \n",
      "the higher percentage of small businesses are related to lower county incomes.  \n",
      "These results are consistent with previous studies showing that over time young and small \n",
      "businesses grow faster and pay higher wages; and they are also consistent with studies showing \n",
      "smaller firms provid e experience and on -the-job training to a broader segment of the population \n",
      "rather than pay higher wages.  \n",
      "The healthcare and social assistance sector results show a positive relationship between counties ’ \n",
      "median household income and the percentage of small businesses. Results for the professional, \n",
      "scientific, and technical consultation services sector indicate a negative relationship for \n",
      "businesses with more than 20 and fewer than 50 employees.   \n",
      "The manufacturing sector is different from  the previous industries because there are both \n",
      "negative and positive relationships between the establishment sizes and the counties’ incomes. \n",
      "Other sectors show negative relationships between business size and incomes.  \n",
      " 59 \n",
      " Introduction  \n",
      "Small businesses are usually associated with job creation but also job destruction, as several of \n",
      "them are unsuccessful in the medium and long run. Nevertheless, other studies have indicated \n",
      "that even though small businesses have low productivity and compe nsations, over time young \n",
      "and small businesses have a tendency to grow faster and pay higher wages in the future \n",
      "(Audretsch, 2002; Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh, 1996; Birch, 1987).  \n",
      "Some studies (Shaffer, 2006a)  have found a negative relationship between establishment size and \n",
      "employment growth, this means that smaller businesses are associated with higher growth; while \n",
      "others (Baptista , Escaria & Madruga, 2008) have argued that the level of business formation and \n",
      "employment growth is more a function of the types and quality of the small businesses.  \n",
      "Several small businesses have positive impacts on wages but the majority do not pay high er \n",
      "wages than their larger competitors. Th is study finds that in some industries the higher \n",
      "percentage of very small firms is positively related to higher incomes. However , in other \n",
      "industries this relationship is reversed: high percentages of small busine sses are related to lower \n",
      "than average county incomes.  \n",
      "These results are consistent with previous research showing that smaller firms do not hire the \n",
      "best educated and skilled workers , however,  they provide experience and on -the-job training to a \n",
      "broader s egment of the population than larger firms on average. In particular, a worker may gain \n",
      "more prompt exposure to a broader segment of the company’s business in a smaller firm, due to \n",
      "a higher degree of integration across functions within the firm (Shaffer, 2006).  Other studies \n",
      "show that over time young and small businesses grow faster and pay higher wages.  \n",
      "This study partially follows Shaffer’s paper (2006b) on the relationship of counties’ median \n",
      "household income growth and the size of establishments in th e U.S. Similar to Shaffer’s paper, \n",
      "the present study  uses a cross -section sample of counties and analyzes how a set of variables, \n",
      "including the relative size of businesses by sector, affects counties’ incomes. Also, similar to \n",
      "Shaffer’s study, we used per centages of units of small businesses by sector rather than the \n",
      "employment percent. Diverging from Shaffer (2006b),  this present study’s dependent variable is \n",
      "counties’ median household income instead of income growth. What's more, instead of four \n",
      "industri al sectors in Shaffer’s research, here six sectors are studied: professional, scientific, and \n",
      "technical services; health care and social assistance; manufacturing; transportation and \n",
      "warehousing; construction; and other services.  \n",
      "The healthcare and social  assistance sector results show a statistically significant positive \n",
      "relationship between counties ’ median household income and the percentage of small businesses. \n",
      "Results for the professional, scientific, and technical consultation services sector demonst rate a \n",
      "statistically significant negative relationship for firms with more than 20 and fewer than 50 \n",
      "employees.   \n",
      "The manufacturing sector is differ s from the previous sectors as there are significant \n",
