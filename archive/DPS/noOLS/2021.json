like. little lacked the ability to accurately judge timeframes and distance.\u00a0at times, little was proven to be off by more than 10 years and 40 miles.\u00a0\u200btherefore,\u00a0years and distances provided in the linked narratives should not be considered definitive.\u00a0little stated he strangled all of his victims, with the exception of two who were drowned, and was adamant he never shot or stabbed them. investigators say the manner in which little killed his victims was more reminiscent to suffocation then strangulation, in that\u00a0several of his victims did not have

while around school buses.  \u201cgoing back to school is an exciting time for students, parents and staff, but it is paramount that drivers are more alert when around buses and schools,\u201d said dps director steven mccraw. \u201ci urge everyone on the road to be proactive and help ensure children arrive to and from school safely each and every day.\u201d  dps offers the following tips for school safety:  \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 give students extra room and don\u2019t assume they are paying attention to traffic. students are frequently distracted by mobile devices or listening on electronic devices and may not be paying attention to their surroundings. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 don\u2019t block a crosswalk when stopped at a red light or stop sign. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 follow the directions of school crossing guards. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 watch for children on bicycles traveling to and from schools. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 reduce speed when you spot a school bus and know children may unexpectedly step into the road without checking for oncoming traffic. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 be careful around railroad crossings. school buses are legally required to stop at them. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 know laws regarding school buses. according to texas law, if a bus has alternating flashing red signals visible from the front or rear, drivers must stop before reaching the bus. drivers can only proceed if the flashing lights are no longer activated, the driver signals you to proceed or the bus has resumed driving. approaching drivers do not have to stop for a school bus that is operating a visual signal if the road is separated by a physical barrier or an intervening space. if a highway is only divided by a left-turn lane, it is not considered divided and drivers must stop for school buses. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 drivers who illegally pass a school bus face fines up to $1,250 for the first offense. for people convicted of the offense more than once, the law allows for the person\u2019s driver license to be suspended for up to six months. a ticket for this offense cannot be dismissed through defensive driving. criminal charges are possible if a driver causes someone serious bodily injury. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 always obey speed limits and traffic laws in school zones. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 remember, texting while driving

adkins, 35, of big spring, was arrested monday, june 14, in big spring and charged with one count of murder in the death of 13-year-old dunn. dunn was last seen on dec. 27, 2010. her mother reported her missing the next day. despite a search, there was no sign of dunn until march 16, 2013, when her remains were found near lake jb thomas in scurry county. adkins had been a suspect in the case, but was never charged. at the time of dunn\u2019s death, he was the live-in boyfriend of dunn\u2019s mother. the circumstances surrounding dunn\u2019s disappearance is what led authorities to adkins initially. ultimately, though, the investigation stalled for lack of new evidence. in 2020, the district attorney for the 32nd judicial district, ricky thompson, consulted with the texas rangers unsolved crimes investigation program (ucip) regarding the case, and the rangers took a new look into the investigation. the rangers interviewed several people, and adkins was identified as the suspect in dunn\u2019s slaying. a search warrant was obtained to collect adkins\u2019 dna. after samples were collected on june 13, an arrest warrant was obtained and adkins was arrested and taken to the howard county jail in big spring. he was then transferred to the mitchell county detention center. bond was set at $2 million. the investigation into the case continues. additional photos: ### (hq

2019. burtnett, then a trooper, was investigating a series of crashes due to zero visibility fog in lubbock county. burtnett had just finished checking on a bystander along the side of the road, when a fast moving tractor-trailer lost control and struck another vehicle. the tractor-trailer went into the ditch, hitting more vehicles as well as burtnett, causing him serious injury. after a series of surgeries, he continues to improve. burtnett was presented a purple heart in recognition of his courageous service and personal sacrifice.\u00a0  trooper jeremy amis, highway patrol \u2014 waco, received a lifesaving award for his actions on april 15, 2020. amis overheard radio traffic from the mclennan county sheriff\u2019s office about a possible suicidal person in lorena and went to the scene. upon arrival, he found the person with a knife to his throat. when the person asked for a cigarette, the trooper located a cigarette and lighter, tossing both just far enough away that he had to move. when the subject went to light the cigarette, he lowered the knife. amis seized the chance and was able to pin the person\u2019s wrists to the ground, while other officers removed the knife and took him into custody. trooper chad brooks, highway patrol \u2014 pampa, received a lifesaving award for his actions on aug. 29, 2020. brooks was eating at a caf\u00e9 when he heard a commotion at a nearby table. brooks saw a 2-year-old boy choking and the child closed his eyes and went limp. brooks immediately jumped up and asked the mother for the child and laid him facedown over his leg, striking the boy on his back.\u00a0as a result, a large piece of food was ultimately dislodged from the little boy\u2019s mouth, and he took a gasp of air and began to cry. brooks ensured the child was alright before returning him to his mother. trooper roy haley, highway patrol \u2014 mckinney, received a lifesaving award for his actions on jan. 20, 2020, when he responded to a domestic disturbance in collin county. an elderly woman had been stabbed by her son. haley saw she was losing a significant amount of blood due to the wound in her arm, so he removed the woman\u2019s jacket and applied a tourniquet from his duty belt. noticing a wound to the woman\u2019s neck, he used gauze from another officer on the scene and applied pressure, which helped reduce the blood loss. the woman was taken by ems to a local hospital, where she fully recovered.  trooper samuel perez, highway patrol \u2014 mission, received a lifesaving award for his actions on aug. 2, 2020, when he attempted a traffic stop on two people on an atv. the driver refused to stop and continued at a high rate of speed, passing other vehicles illegally. eventually, the driver lost control and crashed, causing him and his passenger to be ejected. the driver suffered a large wound on his left arm that was bleeding extensively. perez immediately applied a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. the

received a lifesaving award for their actions on aug. 8, 2020. the two troopers were called to assist the royce city police department after a motorcycle crashed into a guardrail. when robbins and

a lifesaving award for their actions on april 5, 2020. johnson was informed by the atlanta police dispatch that a woman was in cardiac arrest near a texas/louisiana covid-19 checkpoint on u.s. 77.
