{"governor abbott touts educational freedom at parent empowerment night in corpus christi": "january 31, 2023 | austin, texas \n      |\n        \n          press release\n governor greg abbott tonight highlighted the need to expand educational freedom and parental rights in their children's education\u00a0at a parent empowerment night at annapolis christian academy in corpus christi. \u201cour job, as leaders of texas, is to provide the best education possible for our children,\u201d said governor abbott. \u201chundreds of thousands of people move to texas every year because of the freedom and opportunity that texas provides\u2014and because in texas we don\u2019t like government running our lives. parents know that same freedom and opportunity should apply to their children\u2019s education. no one knows better how a child can flourish than their parents, but without educational freedom parents are hindered in helping their child succeed. that must change, and it must change this legislative session.\u201d while governor abbott has provided more funding for public schools and teacher pay raises than any governor in texas history, he noted that more money does not always lead to better-quality education for all students. one way in which parents are able to choose the best learning option for their child is through education savings accounts (esa). in 2020, governor abbott created a limited esa for special needs students, and the texas legislature is proposing an increase in funding for the program because of its overwhelming success. the governor was joined by nueces county judge connie scott, annapolis christian academy headmaster travis lockyer, texas public policy foundation campaign director mandy drogin, and other elected officials and parent empowerment advocates. hosted by the parent empowerment coalition, parent empowerment night brings together education leaders and stakeholders to discuss education reform and the growing need for parental empowerment in their children\u2019s education. p.o. box 12428\naustin texas 78711\n(512) 463-2000", "governor abbott provides update on texas\u2019 severe weather response ": "january

\"i am proud to unveil the 'stop human trafficking' specialty license plate as we raise awareness about the horrific exploitation of men, women, and children across the state,\u201d said governor abbott. \u201ctexas will continue to lead the fight against the scourge of human trafficking by educating the public, supporting survivors, and shedding light on the injustices that many face. we encourage texans across the state to join us in our mission to eradicate human trafficking.\u201d \u201ctexans have a new way to raise awareness about human trafficking and support young survivors,\u201d said hhsc office of family services director megan bermea. \u201ctoo often, human trafficking is hidden in plain sight. we hope this new specialty license plate will bring the issue to light and gain the attention of more people who can help prevent the exploitation of vulnerable people.\u201d beginning february 20, texas drivers may purchase the \u201cstop human trafficking\u201d specialty license plate from the texas department of motor vehicles (txdmv). proceeds from the sale will benefit the stop human trafficking donation account, which pays for treatment services, shelter, and support for youth survivors of human trafficking. governor abbott signed house bill 2633 in june 2021, authorizing the creation of the \u201cstop human trafficking\u201d specialty license plate. last year, hhsc and the txdmv\u00a0launched a 'stop\u00a0 human trafficking' license plate design contest.\u00a0a design by mary b. carr, a licensed professional counselor who works with human trafficking survivors in houston, won the contest. hhsc\u2019s human trafficking resource center\u00a0(htrc) provides a variety of resources to support people experiencing trafficking and offers prevention education and awareness efforts to texans.\u00a0 learn more about about the htrc. p.o. box 12428\naustin texas 78711\n(512) 463-2000", "governor abbott delivers 2023 texas inaugural address": "january 17, 2023 | austin, texas \n      |\n        \n          press release\n to my fellow texans, thank you for your support and trust. thanks to chief justice hecht for administering the oath of office. i want to thank lieutenant governor patrick and speaker phelan for their leadership. thanks to the statewide officials and legislators. we will work together to keep texas the land of opportunity. god has blessed me with a wonderful family, including my extraordinary wife, cecilia, who has championed texans most in need. she has focused on foster care and ending the scourge of human trafficking in texas. she and i share a constant ray of sunshine in our lives, our remarkable daughter, audrey. i also want to thank our family here today, led by my father-in-law, bill phalen. all americans are heirs to the freedom secured by the men and women who have worn the uniform of the mightiest military in the history of the world. my brother, gary, is among them\u2014having served in the navy for 20 years, including flying combat missions in the first gulf war. he is here with his wife, denise. also with us are our texas state and national guard, who are leading the charge to defend our border. they are led by major general suelzer. we would not have the freedom to do events like this one today, if not for the sacrifices made by our brave men and women in uniform. if you\u2019ve ever worn the uniform, please stand or wave so we can show you our gratitude. our state song, \u201ctexas our texas,\u201d is a hymn. a hymn that glorifies the exceptionalism of our state. we work every day to live up to that excellence. it begins like this, and i assure you, i won\u2019t sing it, but i will recite it, because the words are important to who we are as a people. \u201ctexas, our texas! all hail the mighty state! texas, our texas! so wonderful, so great! boldest and grandest, withstanding ev'ry test o empire wide and glorious, you stand supremely blest. god bless you texas! and keep you brave and strong, that you may grow in power and worth, throughout the ages long.\u201d by the grace of god, we have fulfilled that aspiration to be that \u201cmighty state.\u201d texas is america\u2019s undisputed economic leader, providing pathways to prosperity for all texans. our $2 trillion economy is now the ninth-largest in the world. texas is number one in america in producing the food, the fiber, and the fuel that we use every day. the gas you put in your truck, the jeans you wear, the steak you eat for dinner, all of it is made in texas. in fact, \u201cmade in texas\u201d is the mightiest brand in america, and we use it to build the number one economy in the united states. the second line of our state song declares: \u201ctexas, our texas! so wonderful, so great!\u201d texas is great in so many ways. we are home to more fortune 500 headquarters than any state in america. we are now the headquarters of headquarters. we consistently rank number one in economic development and lead the nation in job growth. we\u2019re number one in semiconductor manufacturing. we have the world\u2019s largest medical center. we export more products than any other state. texas is providing opportunity that people cannot get anywhere else. much of our success is driven by our small local businesses. more than 95 percent of texas businesses are small, and they employ nearly half of all working texans. we have more black business owners, hispanic women business owners, and veteran business owners than anywhere else in america. it just shows that everyone can succeed in texas. in fact, more texans have a job today than ever before in the history of our state. that puts more texans on the path to prosperity, through higher wages and unparalleled opportunities. our great economy has produced another record. we now have the largest budget surplus in the history of our state. but make no mistake, that money does not belong to the government. it belongs to the taxpayers. we will use that budget surplus to provide the largest property tax cut in the texas history. our state song goes on to proclaim that we are the \u201cboldest and grandest.\u201d just as early pioneers explored our vast frontier, our modern pioneers are boldly exploring our vast universe. the first word spoken by neil armstrong after landing on the moon was, \u201chouston.\u201d now we have teams in texas that are building the pathway to mars. texas is the epicenter of innovation. we attract the brightest minds and hardest working entrepreneurs. to ensure that our booming state can meet the needs of our future, we must work this session to bolster our infrastructure including, the roads we drive on, the water we use at home and in the fields, and the ports that we use to ship products around the globe. our state is so grand, as texas now has more than 30 million residents. by 2050, there may be 50 million. people from across america are fleeing the oppression of high taxes, red-tape, burdensome regulations in other states, and coming to texas, where freedom and fortune are found around every corner. americans are showing that what davy crockett said still rings true today: \u201cyou may all go to hell. i will go to texas!\u201d texas has also lived up to the next line of our song that we \u201cwithstand every test.\u201d let me highlight just one. i signed 14 bipartisan laws that fixed the flaw in our power grid. then, last summer we set 11 all-time power generation records, and last month we weathered brutally freezing temperatures across the state. all without any disruption to the texas grid. since our bipartisan reforms, no texan has lost power because of our grid. we all know that increased demand will be placed on the grid as texas continues to grow. so, we will build a grid that powers our state for more than just the next four years, but for the next 40 years. the next line of our song states the obvious: \u201co empire wide and glorious, you stand supremely blest.\u201d texas is blessed in so many ways. one of our greatest blessings is our children. one thing they deserve is a quality education. per-student funding for public schools is at an all-time high. we have one of the best high school graduation rates in america. we're number one for national blue ribbon schools, and number one for tier 1 research universities. texas is now the knowledge capital of america. but we must remember this, our schools are for education, not indoctrination. schools should not push social agendas. they must focus on fundamentals. we must reform curriculum to get kids back to the basics of learning and empower parents with the tools to challenge that curriculum when it falls short of expectations. no one knows what is better for a child\u2019s education than their parents. those parents deserve the freedom to choose the education that\u2019s best for their child. one essential part of our schools is safety. we must prioritize protecting students and staff. we must provide mental health services to students who need it. parents must know that their children are safe when they drop them off every morning. we will not end this session without making our schools safer. public safety is a core priority for texas. it flows from the chorus of our state song: \u201cgod bless you texas, and keep you brave and strong.\u201d in texas, we believe in law and order, and we support our law enforcement officers\u2014period. those who serve in law enforcement put their lives on the line for us every day. if you have ever worn the badge, please stand or wave so we can show you the appreciation you deserve for the long hours of service to your community. last session, we passed a law that defunds any city that defunds their police. this session, we must end the easy bail policies that let dangerous criminals back on our streets. we must impose mandatory sentences on criminals caught with guns and on anyone caught smuggling illegal immigrants. make no mistake, the border is a crisis for one simple reason. the biden administration is not enforcing the laws already on the books. as a result, more illegal immigrants crossed our border last year than ever before. in fact, over the past two years more illegal immigrants crossed the border than the populations of austin, el paso, and houston combined. with the biden administration missing in action, texas is using every tool to protect our state. we are building a wall, deploying texas national guard soldiers and department of public safety troopers to enforce the law, and targeting the mexican drug cartels that traffic people, weapons, and drugs into our state. one of the worst consequences of biden\u2019s open border policies is the deadly fentanyl pouring across the border. dps has seized enough fentanyl to kill every man, woman, and child in the united states. in harris county alone, more than one person dies a day because of fentanyl. there are parents with us here today who lost a child to fentanyl. they know we cannot bring back their child, but their hearts cling to the hope that their loss will not be in vain. they deserve action that will save other innocent families from the devastation they suffered. they will get that action this session. the hopes of those parents rest upon leaders in this capitol. our job is to deliver solutions for our fellow texans. that is exactly what we will do. our state song closes with this aspiration: \u201cthat you may grow in power and worth, throughout the ages long.\u201d from our economy, to our people, to our public safety, texas has never wielded more power or enjoyed such economic might as we do today. ever since early pioneers settled our frontier, texas has been the land of opportunity. we have built that brand for generations. we live in a state of infinite possibilities. a state that encourages texans to reach for the heavens and beyond. we provide a ladder for anyone to climb from humble beginnings to the heights of success. a texas where children can access the knowledge and tools they need to be the future entrepreneurs, scientists, and artists that will help shape the texas legend for generations to come. a texas where we value freedom, security, and the rule of law so that everyone can feel safe in their home, workplace, and school. a texas where anyone can design their own destiny and then achieve it. today, we gather on the threshold of a legislative session that will transform the lives of texans for generations. together, we will build the texas of tomorrow, not just for the next four years but for the next century. together, we will ensure that texas remains the greatest state in the greatest country the world has ever known. thank you. god bless you all, and may god bless the great state of texas. p.o. box 12428\naustin texas 78711\n(512) 463-2000", "governor abbott

the puc last year, the performance credit mechanism (pcm) must be given strong consideration,\u201d reads the letter. \u201cas the legislature has noted, a reliability standard must be the foundation

that generators have already publicly committed to build thousands of new megawatts of dispatchable generation resources if the pcm is adopted and implemented by the puc further supports this

discretionary redesignation of the permian basin, the nation's most prolific oil field, in its latest semiannual regulatory agenda.\u00a0if allowed to proceed, the epa\u2019s actions in the permian basin could result in draconian regulations that would directly interfere with 40% of all oil produced in the united states. \"the permian basin is the crown jewel of texas' mighty oil and gas industry, and the state of texas will do whatever it takes to protect its production and the hundreds of thousands of good-paying energy jobs in our state,\" said governor abbott. \"while it is

which can be processed into about 95 million gallons of gasoline a day. in a letter sent to president joe biden about the proposed plan last july, governor abbott pointed out that not only would the epa\u2019s redesignation process lead to higher gas prices for americans by disrupting roughly a quarter of the u.s. oil supply, but it would put hundreds of thousands of good-paying energy jobs at risk. the texas oil and gas industry directly employs more than 422,000 texans and supports 1.37 million texas jobs. the governor also noted that if the epa's proposed redesignation was not suspended, the state of texas would take action necessary to protect the production of oil.\u00a0governor abbott kept up the pressure on the biden administration's ongoing attack on the permian basin, sending another letter last august outlining the flawed logic and data employed to proceed with their stated goal of ending fossil fuels. in january 2021, one week after president biden was sworn in, governor abbott issued an\u00a0executive order\u00a0to protect texas\u2019 energy industry from federal overreach following a roundtable in odessa with energy workers, leaders, and advocates. the executive
