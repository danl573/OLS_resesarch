\u00a0the office of court administration can, and is encouraged to, create model forms to help achieve the commendable goals behind senate bill 1458. \u00a0but the bill would go further and impose categorical mandates that courts use standardized forms, without addressing what happens if a court deviates from the prescribed form and without allowing flexibility for unique cases. \u00a0i vetoed similar legislation last session because, without appropriate safeguards, mandating the use of standardized forms in criminal cases sets a trap for courts whose orders may be challenged as void for deviating from the form and creates loopholes for opportunistic litigants to pursue needless challenges. \u00a0i appreciate the good intentions of the bill author and sponsor in aiming to protect the

on the same property. \u00a0but those are contractual rights the parties bargained for, and the interest-holder could have given something up in exchange for protection from a wash out. \u00a0the

2803 goes about it in the wrong way, pitting tenants against other tenants and landlords, and drawing in basic licensing rules that are unrelated to trafficking. \u00a0texas law already allows a landlord to seek forcible eviction upon a reasonable belief that a tenant is engaging in prostitution or human trafficking on the premises. \u00a0under house bill 2803, however, one tenant could have another tenant dragged into court just by making an accusation to the landlord, of something as mundane as sloppy recordkeeping by a massage establishment. \u00a0that is no basis for governmental interference with a private contract between the landlord and the finger-pointing tenant. \u00a0and the landlord is caught in the middle, practically forced to file against an allegedly offending

texas' southern border in response to the border crisis, providing more resources and strategies to combat the ongoing influx of unlawful immigrants. the governor is authorizing the use of all necessary and available state and local resources to protect landowners in these counties from trespassers and the damage they cause to private property. the governor has also directed the texas department of public safety to enforce all federal and state criminal laws, including criminal trespassing, smuggling, and human trafficking. the governor directed the texas health and human services commission to take all necessary steps to discontinue state licensure of any child care facility under a contract with the federal government that shelters or detains unlawful immigrants. additionally, the governor directed the texas commission on jail standards and the texas commission on law enforcement to work\u00a0with texas counties to provide appropriate guidance and request any necessary waivers in order to give counties the flexibility needed to establish adequate alternative detention facilities or otherwise add or expand capacity. the governor also directed these agencies to streamline procedures for licensing and transfers, and to address any staffing issues that may arise in expanding capacity. \"president biden's open-border policies have paved the way for dangerous gangs and cartels, human traffickers, and deadly drugs like fentanyl to pour into our communities,\" said governor abbott. \"meanwhile, landowners along the border are seeing their property damaged
