greg abbott, governor of texas, issued a disaster proclamation on march 13, 2020, certifying under section 418.014 of the texas government code that the novel coronavirus (covid-19) poses an imminent threat of disaster for all texas counties; and \nwhereas, in each subsequent month effective through today, i have renewed the covid-19 disaster declaration for all texas counties; and \nwhereas, i have issued a series of executive orders aimed at protecting the health and safety of texans, ensuring uniformity throughout texas, and achieving the least restrictive means of combatting the evolving threat to public health; and \nwhereas, covid-19 vaccines are strongly encouraged for those eligible to receive one, but have always been voluntary for texans; and \nwhereas, i issued executive orders ga-35 and ga-38, addressing covid-19 vaccines administered under an \u201cemergency use authorization\u201d by prohibiting vaccine mandates from governmental entities and by prohibiting \u201cvaccine passports\u201d from governmental entities and certain others; and \nwhereas, subsequently, on august 23, 2021, while the legislature was already convened in a special session, the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) approved one of the covid-19 vaccines for certain age groups, such that this vaccine is no longer administered under an emergency use authorization for those age groups; and \nwhereas, while this covid-19 vaccine is now fda-approved for certain age groups, others are not yet approved and still are administered under an emergency use authorization; and \nwhereas, through chapter 161 of the texas health and safety code, as well as other laws including chapters 38 and 51 of the texas education code, the legislature has established its primary role over immunizations, and all immunization laws and regulations in texas stem from the laws established by the legislature; and \nwhereas, in other contexts where the legislature has imposed immunization requirements, it has also taken care to provide exemptions that allow people to opt out of being forced to take a vaccine; and \nwhereas, given the legislature\u2019s primacy and the need to avoid a patchwork of regulations with respect to vaccinations, it is appropriate to maintain the status quo of prohibiting vaccine mandates through executive order while allowing the legislature to consider this issue while in session; and \nwhereas, in this instance, given the legislature\u2019s prior actions, maintaining the status quo of prohibiting vaccine mandates and ensuring uniformity pending the legislature\u2019s consideration means extending the voluntariness of covid-19 vaccinations to all covid-19 vaccinations, regardless of regulatory status; and \nwhereas, i am also adding this issue to the agenda for the second called session of the legislature that is currently convened so that the legislature has the opportunity to consider this issue through legislation; and \nwhereas, i will rescind this executive order upon the effective date of such legislation;\u00a0 \nnow, therefore, i, greg abbott, governor of texas, by virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the

the ability of a nursing home, state supported living center, assisted living facility, or long-term care facility to require documentation of a resident\u2019s vaccination status for any covid-19
