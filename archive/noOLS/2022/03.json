"march 1, 2022 | austin, texas \n      |\n        \n          proclamation\n first by the pen and then by the sword, brave texans fought for their independence from a tyrannical government in mexico that denied its citizens basic freedoms. \u00a0in the fall of 1835 at gonzales, texans of all backgrounds banded together to fight for the cause of liberty and defend what was rightfully theirs. \u00a0months later, on march 2, 1836, while delegates gathered at washington-on-the-brazos to sign the texas declaration of independence, brave defenders continued fighting for their freedom. \u00a0 many heroic texans were lost throughout the revolution, most notably all of the defenders of the alamo and those at presidio la bah\u00eda in goliad. \u00a0yet, their sacrifices were not made in vain and would serve as a rallying cry for the texan forces under general sam houston. \u00a0he raised an army and soundly defeated santa anna at the battle of san jacinto on april 21, 1836, declaring victory and securing freedom for the new republic of texas. as those delegates declared nearly 200 years ago, when a government ceases to protect the lives, liberty, and property of the people from whom its power is derived, that government becomes an instrument of oppression which must be abolished. \u00a0in rebellion against the actions of the mexican government, fearless texans gave rise to a free and sovereign republic. the vision of freedom set down by our founders in the texas declaration of independence lives on in the indomitable texas spirit today. \u00a0as we continue to build a 21st-century texas, we must always remember how the sacrifices of past generations helped create a future for the next. \u00a0at this time, i encourage all texans to learn more about, reflect on, and take pride in our state\u2019s unique origins and rich history. therefore, i, greg abbott, governor of texas, do hereby proclaim march 2, 2022, to be texas independence day in texas and urge the appropriate\u00a0 recognition whereof. in official recognition whereof,\u00a0 i hereby affix my signature this the 24th day of february, 2022. governor greg abbott view the proclamation p.o. box

american spirit of grit and ingenuity is renowned throughout the world. \u00a0from the founding of this great nation to the present, americans continuously solve new problems, create new inventions, and reach new heights. \u00a0texas women in particular have made significant contributions to this legacy. texas women claim many firsts\u2014like mary austin holley, who wrote the first english book about texas in the 1830s. \u00a0texas is home to one of the first female cattle drivers, margaret borland, and one of the first black women to serve in the u.s. house of representatives, barbara jordan. \u00a0miriam \u201cma\u201d ferguson, who governed our state for two terms, was among the first female governors in the nation. \u00a0others broke the glass ceiling in business, like carrie marcus neiman, cofounder of neiman marcus, and the legendary mary kay ash. \u00a0 still others have made their mark more recently through their unique and outstanding talents, like selena quintanilla, the queen of tejano music, and simone biles, america\u2019s most decorated gymnast. \u00a0countless other texas women across the lone star state serve as elected and appointed officials, playing an important role in both government and their communities. in recognition of the importance of our country\u2019s women, congress has designated march as a time to reflect on women\u2019s accomplishments. \u00a0during this month, texans young and old can learn of the contributions of women immortalized by history while recognizing the potential of tomorrow\u2019s women to make the world a better place. at this time, i encourage all texans to join me in honoring the women of the lone star state and recognizing their accomplishments. \u00a0let us remain committed to supporting the invaluable work of all texas women and learning more about their noteworthy contributions to our state and nation. therefore, i, greg abbott, governor of texas, do hereby proclaim march 2022, to
