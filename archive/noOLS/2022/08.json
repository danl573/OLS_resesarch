includes a historic increase in funding to $14 billion for projects in rural areas. the $8.5 billion of average annual investment programmed in the utp over the next 10 years is expected to yield an estimated $15.5 billion per year in economic benefits, according to the texas a&m transportation institute. these benefits are a result of increased labor income and business output, as well as the

representing precinct 4, and constable ted heap, representing precinct 5, to the texas comptroller for investigation. the comptroller recently released its finding that the harris county commissioners court acted to significantly reduce\u00a0resources available to the county's constables office. \"the dangerous actions taken by judge lina hidalgo and harris county represent a brazen disregard for the safety and security of the texans they are sworn to protect,\" said governor abbott. \"the loss of millions of dollars in funding will endanger public safety across the county at a time when texas law enforcement is working harder than ever to keep criminals and dangerous drugs out of our communities. harris county continues to show complete negligence for public safety, as the same county whose revolving door bail program releases dangerous criminals back onto the streets to commit more violent crimes like murder. while harris county politicizes the public safety of its citizens, the

the action\u00a0could jeopardize a quarter of the nation\u2019s gasoline supply. the letter reiterates how the epa is employing flawed logic and data to proceed with the biden administration\u2019s

president biden detailing how epa plans to impose a discretionary redesignation of the permian basin could result in draconian regulations that would interfere with the nation\u2019s most prolific oil

arbitrary discretionary redesignation. the texas oil and gas industry directly employs more than 422,000 texans and supports 1.37 million total direct and indirect texas jobs. producers in the permian basin are responsible for 5.2 million barrels of oil per day, which can be processed into about 95 million gallons of gasoline a day, according to the u.s. energy information administration. following
