said governor abbott. \"as we continue to deploy all available resources in response to widespread fire and drought conditions, texans are encouraged to remain vigilant and weather-aware to protect themselves and their loved ones from dangerous wildfires.\" according to the texas a&m forest service, critically-to-extremely dry vegetation and critical fire weather will likely increase wildfire activity this week. areas of concern include the eastern rolling plains, cross timbers, central texas, north texas near the waco and dallas-fort worth areas, and south along the i-35 corridor near the capital region. the risk for significant fires has expanded east to include portions of east texas, including areas near palestine, crockett, huntsville, tyler, and marshall. at the direction of governor abbott, tdem is coordinating the state\u2019s response to the active wildfires and collaborating with the texas a&m forest service. the texas a&m forest service has mobilized at least 105 dozers, 87 engines, and three motograders across texas. in addition, 38 aircraft, including five large airtankers, one very large airtanker, 12 single engine airtankers, one lead place, five air attack platforms, and 12 helicopters have been activated to support firefighters combatting active wildfires. hundreds of firefighting personnel are responding to fires statewide, including seven strike teams and a hand crew module deployed through the texas intrastate fire mutual aid system (tifmas), totaling more than 115 firefighters, 30 engines, and four water tenders. additionally, land management agencies from 36 states are supporting the firefighting response in texas with 535 personnel and 145 pieces of equipment. the texas emergency medical task force (emtf) has a total of 35 personnel activated, as well as five ambulances and 10 utility task vehicles (utvs). the personnel total includes five medical unit leaders, 12 wildland paramedic units, eight personnel in utvs, and 10 ambulance personnel. last week, governor abbott renewed a wildfire disaster declaration that includes 72 counties affected by wildfire threats. the governor also renewed a drought disaster declaration for 189 counties affected by exceptional drought conditions. according to the latest update from the u.s. drought monitor, more than 99 percent of the state is experiencing some level of drought conditions. according to the texas a&m forest service, rainfall that some communities received last week only offered a temporary reprieve from the dry conditions. texans sustaining damage related to wildfires are encouraged to submit damage assessments through tdem\u2019s self-reporting survey at damage.tdem.texas.gov. users should select \"wildfire outbreak\" as the active incident.

police department narcotics commander bryan bennett, and dps crime laboratory chief brady mills and seized drug system trainer jennifer hatch.\u00a0 \"because of president biden's open border policies, deadly fentanyl is flooding america, with enough seized lethal doses to kill almost every man, woman, and child in the nation,\" said governor abbott. \"mexican drug cartels are smuggling fentanyl into our country any way they can. it is laced into every other street drug available, as well as being disguised as legal prescriptions, as this lab has discovered. because of the folks at this lab, who handle potentially lethal drugs every day, we are saving the lives of thousands of texans from the deadly scourge of fentanyl.\" \"fentanyl deaths affect texans across all demographics,\" said senator huffman. \"parents should be aware of fentanyl and educate their children about the deadliness of this drug. the legislature increased penalties against fentanyl manufacturing and distribution last session, but we will look to increase penalties even further this upcoming legislative session as a result of this growing crisis.\"\u00a0 \"cartels along the

grandparents should talk to their children about the risks of counterfeit pills.\" state and law enforcement officials also reminded texans that they can play a significant role in stopping the spread of fentanyl and fentanyl-related deaths by educating their children about the deadliness of the drug and how it can be disguised in counterfeit prescription drugs.\u00a0 dps' houston crime lab has tested almost 13,700 lbs. of counterfeit drugs in the past 12 months and inventoried more than 85,000 seized drugs, including more than 9,700 deadly opioids like fentanyl. in texas, almost 1,700
