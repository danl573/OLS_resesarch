military department has been the subject\nof scurrilous accusations by seemingly reputable media sources. specifically,\nallegations raised relate to the department\u2019s activation of military personnel to support\noperation lone star, a state active duty mission related to a disaster declaration issued\nby gov. greg abbott. after multiple failed attempts to correct the record with these outlets, the texas military\ndepartment wants to set the record straight to ensure accurate reporting on this\nmission. it is clear that reporters have gleaned information from anonymous sources and\nunverified documents, which have then been skewed to push an agenda. allegations\nrelate to the state\u2019s mobilization, deployment, and operations in support of operation\nlone star. they specifically concern the rapid deployment, pay, hardship requests,\nsuicides, equipment and living conditions, and covid protocols. rapid deployment some have attempted to compare our current disaster response effort to enduring\nfederal overseas missions, which allow more time for planning and preparation.\nhowever, this mission is a direct response to a state-declared disaster occurring in\nour own backyard, requiring an immediate response. the department rapidly surged\nfrom 500 personnel to more than 10,000 in a matter of months, due to a dramatic influx\nof migrant caravans across the texas-mexico border. in may 2021, gov. greg abbott declared the disaster, which states, in part, \u201c\u2026the\nfederal government has shown unwillingness, ambivalence, or inability to enforce\nfederal immigration laws, to deter and stop illegal border crossings into the united\nstates, or to meaningfully partner with texas in pursuing these goals.\u201d clearly, the state\nof texas had to react to protect texans and the nation. pay there have been nebulous charges that service members are not being paid. this is\ninaccurate. while there have been administrative pay challenges, currently every\nservice member assigned to operation lone star is being paid.\nfollowing hurricane harvey, the agency conducted a thorough after-action review,\nwhich identified issues with the pay system the agency was using at that time. based on the review, tmd procured and implemented a new pay system for state\nactive duty missions. ols has been, by far, the largest onboarding of service members\ninto the current state payroll system and will be the longest-running state active duty\nmission utilizing this payroll system. this has given tmd the opportunity to identify gaps within the system, which are being\nactively addressed. specifically, on sunday, jan. 16, pay strike teams arrived along\nthe border to support individual service members with pay questions. to date,\napproximately 75 percent of pay discrepancies have been resolved, to include, back\npay for those who have been paid inaccurate amounts. in addition to their chain of command, service members may utilize the 24/7 tmd pay hotline to\naddress any pay discrepancies (512-782-1234). hardship requests there have been false reports that the texas military department has systemically or\nroutinely denied personnel hardship release requests. to date, there have been more\nthan 900 requests received, 75 percent of which have been granted. it is important to\nremember, hardship requests are granted on a case-by-case basis depending on the\nindividual service member\u2019s circumstances. suicides in regards to four service member deaths, there has been misleading and false\ninformation pushed to the public without proper context, irrespective of family\nsensitivities and desires. two of the four service members mentioned by outlets were\nmobilized in support of operation lone star. those investigations are still ongoing.\nhowever, there is no evidence to support an assumption that their decisions were made\nas a direct result of hardship denials. it would be irresponsible journalism at this point in\ntime to tie these tragedies to operation lone star.\nin calendar year 2021, out of more than 22,000 personnel, the texas military\ndepartment has experienced 9 suicides within our ranks. tmd leadership has met with\neach of the families and is providing all available resources. at the request of the\nfamilies visited, tmd asks the media to respect the family\u2019s right to privacy during their\ntime of grieving. equipment and living conditions there have been inaccurate reports and social media posts attempting to malign and\nundermine texas military department efforts to support our service members along the border.\u00a0 our personnel are trained to operate and adapt in austere environments at\nhome and abroad. as with any mission, we continue to adjust as the situation evolves.\ncommanders in the field have identified areas of improvement in regards to equipment\nand living conditions and are actively working with vendors and supply chains to\nexecute those solutions. since the start of operation lone star, thousands of vehicles and heavy equipment,\nincluding those with advanced optics, as well weapons, ammunition, ballistic vests and\nplates, have deployed into the texas-mexico border region to support the men and\nwomen on the ground. in recent weeks, supplemental cold and wet weather gear have\nbeen delivered to service members, ensuring those supporting operation lone star\nhave appropriate protective gear. covid-19 protocol like all sectors of society, the covid-19 pandemic has impacted members of the\ntexas military department. as of today, less than 1 percent of the state\u2019s military force\nis in quarantine/isolation. the texas military department follows isolation/quarantine and contact tracing\nprotocols for covid positive members. additionally, guardsmen have access to\npersonal protective equipment, testing, vaccines, and antibody therapeutics. tmd\u2019s\nmedical professionals have oversight of these protocols and ensure service members\nare monitored on a daily basis while in isolation/quarantine, and are cleared prior to\nreturning to duty. mission effects because of our service members\u2019
