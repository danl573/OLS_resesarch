executive authority to grant an emergency exception to the uniform election date requirements, pursuant to sections 41.001 and 41.0011 of the texas election code, and to grant permission for the city of galveston to order a special, emergency election for the purpose of electing a member to fill a vacancy in galveston city council district no. 1; and\u00a0 whereas, the recent death of the incumbent for galveston city council district no. 1 has created a vacancy on the city council; and\u00a0 whereas, the members of the city council are elected for two-year terms at elections conducted every even-numbered year on the may uniform election date; and\u00a0 whereas, the city charter provides, in article ii, section 3, that \u201c[i]f a seat on the council becomes vacant, it shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at a special election called for such purpose, unless the next regular city election is to be held within one hundred twenty (120) days from the time of such vacancy\u201d; and\u00a0 whereas, because the next regular election day for the city of galveston is in excess of one hundred twenty (120) days from the date the vacancy occurred, a special

code, the next regular election day for the city of galveston is the uniform election date on may 7, 2022; and\u00a0 whereas, section 41.0011 of the texas election code provides that a special election may be held as an emergency election before the appropriate uniform election date if a political subdivision asks the governor for permission to do so and the governor determines that an emergency exists; and whereas, the city of galveston intends to redistrict its city council district seats this fall, and without an elected member for galveston city council district no. 1, the district would be unrepresented during that important process; and\u00a0 whereas, the unique circumstances faced by the city of galveston as a result of the vacancy in galveston city council district no. 1 indicate that the interest of the voters in that district would be best served by permitting the vacancy to be filled by an election at the earliest practical date;\u00a0 now, therefore, i, greg

june 26, 2021. this includes the $300 weekly unemployment supplement from the federal pandemic unemployment compensation program. \u201cthe texas economy is booming and employers are hiring in communities throughout the state,\u201d said governor abbott. \u201caccording to the texas workforce commission, the number of job openings in texas is almost identical to the number of texans who are receiving unemployment benefits. that assessment does not include the voluminous jobs that typically are not listed, like construction and restaurant jobs. in fact, there are nearly 60 percent more jobs open (and listed) in texas today than there was in february 2020, the month before the pandemic hit texas.\u201d the current job openings are good paying jobs. according to the texas workforce commission (twc), nearly 45 percent of posted jobs offer wages greater than $15.50 per hour.\u00a0 approximately 76 percent pay more than $11.50 per hour. only 2 percent of posted jobs pay around the minimum wage. at this stage of opening the state 100 percent, the focus must be on helping unemployed texans connect with the more than a million job openings, rather than paying unemployment benefits to remain off the employment rolls. another reason why today\u2019s action is needed is the high level of fraudulent unemployment claims being filed. fraudulent unemployment claims rob taxpayer money and do nothing to help the unemployed. twc estimates that nearly 18 percent of all claims for unemployment benefits during the pandemic are confirmed or suspected to be fraudulent, which totals more than 800,000 claims, worth as much as $10.4 billion, if all claims had been paid. federal law requires the effective date of this change to be at least 30 days after notification is provided to the
