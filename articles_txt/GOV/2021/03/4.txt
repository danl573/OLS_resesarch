          press release
 governor greg abbott and the texas department of public safety (dps) today launched operation lone star to combat the smuggling of people and drugs into texas. the operation integrates dps with the texas national guard and deploys air, ground, marine, and tactical border security assets to high threat areas to deny mexican cartels and other smugglers the ability to move drugs and people into texas. “the crisis at our southern border continues to escalate because of biden administration policies that refuse to secure the border and invite illegal immigration,” said governor abbott. “texas supports legal immigration but will not be an accomplice to the open border policies that cause, rather than prevent, a humanitarian crisis in our state and endanger the lives of texans. we will surge the resources and law enforcement personnel needed to confront this crisis.” this decision follows a meeting last month between governor abbott and dps director colonel steve mccraw where they discussed strategies to enhance safety and security along the border. p.o. box 12428
