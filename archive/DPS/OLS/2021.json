(dps) today held a briefing at dps\u2019 regional headquarters in weslaco to discuss progress made so far during operation lone star (ols), the mission to secure the southern border under the direction of governor greg abbott. today\u2019s briefing discussed the significant achievements of ols which was launched by governor abbott on march 4. since then air, ground and marine operations have successfully disrupted the operations of mexican cartels, human and drug smugglers, as well as other threats crossing the border into texas. \u201ctexas guardsmen leave their homes to support their state and prevent criminal elements from entering texas,\u201d said maj. gen. tracy norris, the adjutant general of texas. \u201cwe have a long history of enduring relationships with local, state and federal agencies in conducting homeland security missions that dates back more than 100 years, and we are proud to continue this legacy as texans serving texas.\u201d the tmd\u2019s primary mission in ols is to observe and report any illegal activity in high drug and human trafficking areas. in august, governor abbott announced he was sending additional guardsmen to the border, bringing the current number to around 1,000. \u201cone of the most significant threats to public safety and homeland security in texas is an unsecured international border with mexico,\u201d said dps director steven mccraw. \u201cthe failure to secure it has enabled the mexican cartels to evolve into the most powerful and ruthless criminal organizations in the world, reaping billions of dollars from the trafficking of people and illicit drugs throughout the nation. dps remains committed to enforcing the law and thwarting these criminals.\u201d as referenced in the briefing, as of sept. 2, dps has made: there are six mexican cartels that control areas of access into texas and use violent, transnational and texas-based gangs to transport illicit drugs and traffic people, operate stash houses, conduct enforcement operations and provide retail drug distribution in communities throughout the state. disrupting these gang and cartel activities has a direct impact on what happens in texas and the u.s. from october 2020 through september 2021, there have been a record number of migrant apprehensions and referrals in texas, totaling more than 1.1 million people. the previous record was just more than 726,000 in 1986, when mexican cartels did not pose the threat to public safety that they do today. since ols began, dps has seen a steep increase in vehicle pursuits. in the del rio area, pursuits are up 774% through july of this year with 236, compared to 27 in 2020. in the laredo area there is an 86% increase year-over-year, with 140 in 2021 compared to 75 the year before. similarly, the rio grande valley saw a 40% increase in pursuits, with 163 through july 2021, compared to 116 in 2020. another joint briefing is set for dps\u2019 regional headquarters in weslaco on thursday,

texas-mexico border.\" \"texas law enforcement and soldiers sent to the border under a state initiative that began in march have encountered more than 165,000 people presumed to have illegally crossed the u.s.-mexico border or are themselves smuggling people, according to the texas department of public safety. \"lt. chris olivarez, spokesman for the texas dps\u2019s south region, said during a press conference thursday that his agency's troopers, along with national guard soldiers, and the texas parks and wildlife department have apprehended and referred 165,000 people to relevant law enforcement for arrest over the past nine months.\" \u201csome of the landowners were voicing concerns that illegal immigrants were trespassing on their property, damaging their fences. they didn't feel safe around their homes because of these illegal immigrants who were coming across,\u201d said olivarez. \"olivarez said troopers have arrested migrants who have criminal records, and criminal gang members including ms-13 and cartel members. \u00a0 he said some of the migrants have become aggressive when approached by officers. \u201cthey resist our law enforcement. there's been several incidents where they throw rocks at our law enforcement personnel because again, they're trying to avoid apprehension,\u201d said olivarez.\" \u201cthe landowners there were getting frustrated. they had these illegal immigrants that were coming across in their property, destroying their properties. they didn't feel safe at their homes,\u201d said olivarez. \u201cso, texas had to step in, and that\u2019s why we deployed dps. we were able to get consent to be on those properties to make arrests for criminal trespass, as well as the rail yards.\u201d \"olivarez said the majority of the migrants who have moved through the val verde county processing facility were arrested for trespassing on private ranchlands and on the trains. \u201cthese are individuals who are avoiding detection, avoiding law enforcement,\u201d said olivarez. \u201cthese are the single adults that are trying to get across and move further inland.\u201d \u00a0 \"in march, gov. greg abbott initiated operation lone star to address the surge that seems to have only gotten worse as the months have gone on. similar to what i have heard from border patrol agents, the different state troopers i spoke with said they have never seen such a stark uptick in illegal activity at the border as to what they are seeing now. ... \"u.s. border patrol is overwhelmed with the constant illegal entries that are taking place because it involves a lot of processing, a lot of hours. that can't be ignored, that is a crisis. there is a problem right now. i know conversations have been out there that the border is closed. the border is not closed when you have 2,000 illegal entries taking place daily,\" said lt. christopher olivarez, a dps spokesman.\" \"a clay county trooper rescued a 6-month-old girl and her mother from drowning after smugglers threw them out of a raft floating in the rio grande, texas officials said.\"  \"on march 16, the texas department of public safety\u2019s south texas special operations group helped u.s. border patrol rescue a 6-month old girl from the rio grande river. \"texas dps lt. christopher olivarez told kveo that the mother and child had been waiting in mexico since december to cross into the u.s. \"the mother paid smugglers $3,500 to cross the rio grande river into the u.s. the mom was assaulted by the smugglers in mexico, which resulted in a broken leg, according to olivarez.\" \"victor escalon, regional director of the texas department of public safety, says he worried the more people are smuggled across the rio grande, the more opportunities for criminal organizations to flourish in the area. \u201cas a parent, as a human being, you want to make sure (migrant children) are cared for. they are kids. they don\u2019t know any different,\u201d he said. \u201cbut the more people you bring across, the individuals who are in charge of coordinating the criminal element, the smuggling of narcotics they are going to look for opportunities.\u201d \"while the press continues to get limited access to operations at the donna tent facility, texas state troopers allowed channel 5 news to see first-hand what\u2019s happening on the border during the migrant surge \u2026 in just two weeks since the start of operation lone star, state police has been involved in 34 vehicle pursuits and has referred 8,000 migrants to border patrol. although texas dps cannot enforce u.s. immigration laws, their presence aims to serve as a deterrent to drug and human traffickers.\" \"there was a gaggle of us, journalists, who couldn\u2019t be along the banks of the river at several points of migrant crossings without the escort of either local, state or federal law enforcement. texas department of public safety troopers took us on a tour. on march 6, gov. greg abbott and dps launched operation lone star. what we saw on this day was part of that effort.\" \"in a bird\u2019s-eye view of the surge of migrants at the southern border, new camera images show dozens of people, including families, crossing into the u.s. within minutes. nbc\u2019s gabe gutierrez reports for today from laredo, texas.\" @txdps @txdps \u00a0 txdeptpublicsafety texas dps mobile
