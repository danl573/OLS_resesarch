commissioner mike morath and school superintendents statewide, the governor explains that his executive order ga-39, issued on august 25, 2021, allows texas parents to opt out of the covid-19 vaccine for their children and further empowers parents to be the primary decisionmakers in their children\u2019s health care. also, the texas legislature has enabled parents to opt out of vaccinating their children for health reasons and reasons of conscience through a number of statutes, including texas education code \u00a7 38.01(c)(1), texas health & safety code \u00a7\u00a7 161.004(d), 161.0041, and

schools shall not require students to receive the covid-19 vaccine for any reason.\u201d although the recent cdc recommendations do not create a federal vaccine mandate, many schools rely on cdc
