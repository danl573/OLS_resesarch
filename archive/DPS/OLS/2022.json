{"dps launches campaign to fight fentanyl": "austin \u2013 this month, the texas department of public safety (dps) answered governor greg abbott\u2019s call to action for state agencies by launching a new public awareness campaign to highlight the dangers of fentanyl. the multi-pronged campaign includes posting informational signage in dps buildings, public service announcements at driver license offices statewide and publishing a webpage offering valuable resources. \u201cfentanyl is now the deadliest drug threat facing texas and the nation, with thousands of innocent texans and americans losing their lives to this clandestine killer,\u201d said governor greg abbott. \u201cwith help from state agencies, texas is increasing efforts to stop mexican drug cartels from smuggling this deadly drug into our communities, as well as raising awareness of the danger this drug poses, even with just one pill. i thank dps for their tireless work supporting the recently launched \u2018one pill kills\u2019 campaign to keep texans safe from this deadly scourge. the state of texas is deploying all resources to address the growing national fentanyl crisis and help prevent more innocent lives from being lost.\u201d fentanyl makes its way into our communities as a consequence of an unsecure southern border. in march 2021, at the direction of governor abbott, dps launched operation lone star (ols) to help combat that influx of drugs. since ols began, dps alone has seized more than 350 million potentially lethal doses of fentanyl statewide. \u201cthe mexican cartels have taken fentanyl and massed produced counterfeit pills to look like oxycontin, oxycodone, percocet and other pills and people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re taking,\u201d said dps director steven mccraw. \u201cthey think they are taking adderall or something else and what they are really getting is a lethal dose of fentanyl.\u201d  the goal of the department\u2019s new public awareness campaign is to boost governor abbott\u2019s recently announced \u201cone pill kills\u201d campaign in a collaborative effort to reach as many people as possible. signage detailing the dangers of synthetic opioids are being posted in more than 350 public facing dps buildings across the state, including driver license (dl) offices and other state buildings.  additionally, public services announcements (psas) will begin playing in the waiting areas of 181 dl offices statewide later this month. these 30 second psas will educate viewers and provide useful resources in the fight against fentanyl. dps also published a webpage dedicated to educating texans about fentanyl and its dangers. this will serve as a resource where people can learn more about the deadly drug, how to talk to kids about the dangers, and other helpful information to provide texans with the knowledge they need to protect themselves. visit www.dps.texas.gov/onepillkills to learn more. ###\u00a0(hq 2022-074)  @txdps @txdps

jenna roark, 45, of el paso, and a 15-year-old juvenile on charges of smuggling of persons and aggravated kidnapping.\u00a0 the charges stem from a sept. 16, traffic stop conducted by dps troopers working operation lone star. troopers discovered roark and the juvenile were smuggling illegal immigrants and were also traveling with an unidentified 18-month-old boy.\u00a0the child was in poor

currency in the northwest texas region. in august 2017, the department created sergeant area 5b10 which was comprised of one sergeant and nine troopers. the 5b10 area concentrated efforts along i-40, with an emphasis on drivers crossing the texas panhandle smuggling narcotics and illegally gained us currency. from august 2017 through december 2021, the unit had 320 significant illicit drug and currency seizures. this included marijuana, thc products, methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin and fentanyl, as well as more than five-million-dollars in us currency. the success is due to their criminal interdiction techniques in roadside interviews, vehicle searches and their knowledge of fourth amendment search and seizure case law. these troopers have been recognized both statewide and nationally for their efforts, and recently received the national criminal interdiction award from the white house office of national drug policy for the year 2020. the employees commended for their hard work and dedication include sergeant oscar esqueda, corporal darrin bridges, troopers danny nunez, richard pacheco, edgar castillo ii, max honesto, alexandrea moroles, stephen bond, michael little and jorge perez. the following individuals or groups were also recognized for their significant achievements: the watch intelligence and information program (wiip) is the recipient of the 2021/2022 national fusion center association best collaborative effort award. as the 24/7 component of the texas fusion center, wiip collaborates with multiple internal and external partners to provide a wide range of analytic support to law enforcement and public safety officials throughout texas and the nation.\u00a0 analysts in the wiip exhibit the highest level of vigilance, teamwork, dedication and excellence in analytic tradecraft, which are essential, given the broad range of responsibilities they oversee. however, nowhere is the wiip\u2019s commitment and collaboration more evident than its handling of suspicious activity reporting, including threats to life.\u00a0  on september 15, 2021, wiip analysts received a tip from a community member via the iwatchtexas website in which the reporting party was concerned about posts made on a popular chat/social media platform, by a user who claimed to have killed his family.\u00a0 through advanced open-source intelligence research and collaboration with the fbi, dps criminal investigations division, and local law enforcement in texas and alabama, the analysts helped the san patricio sheriff\u2019s office positively identify and locate the juvenile subject at his home in ingleside, texas.\u00a0 the subject refused to surrender and ultimately committed suicide.\u00a0 upon entering the subject\u2019s home, deputies discovered the subject had indeed shot and killed his mother, father, sister, and family dogs. a search of the subject\u2019s vehicle revealed a large number of firearms and ammunition, as well as other evidence that indicated the subject was likely planning a school attack. while the deaths of the family are undeniably tragic, the swift response by the analysts and the coordination with investigative partners helped prevent further tragedy. this is one of the countless examples of dedication and excellence these analysts display every day. the 2021/2022 fusion center award was recently given to two maritime intelligence analysts, hilary martinez, intelligence and counterterrorism division \u2013 headquarters, and marisa brusuelas, intelligence and counterterrorism division \u2013 houston. the joint maritime domain awareness steering committee recognized their excellence and dedication in every aspect of their roles as analysts with the texas fusion center and how it has greatly enhanced the relationship with the maritime industry, while simultaneously strengthening the overall security posture for this domain. the analysts routinely strive to meet the intelligence needs of their customers and increase nationwide awareness of threats in the maritime domain through their intelligence products. their attention to detail, hard work and commitment to maritime security in texas and nationwide have earned the fusion center\u2019s maritime intelligence program countless distinctions and praise from partners, who undoubtedly view the analysts as intelligence leaders in the maritime domain in texas and nationwide. maritime intelligence analyst hilary martinez, intelligence and counterterrorism division \u2013 headquarters, was also recently recognized with the 2021/2022 michael schooler critical infrastructure protection award. in 2021, martinez made important contributions to a texas dps intelligence assessment that identified key threats to the texas maritime environment based on suspicious activity reporting. she authored an information bulletin that discussed malicious cyber activity which targeted maritime facilities in texas by exploiting ongoing, real-time threats such as the covid-19 pandemic and the atlantic hurricane season. her daily monitoring helps protect maritime and critical infrastructure in her sector from suspicious activity and potential physical threats from numerous actors, including those affiliated with hostile foreign nations, transnational criminal organizations and terrorism. her duties are important for state and national security, and she performs them with exceptional work ethic and competence.  please join us in honoring all the above award recipients. we thank them for their tremendous work in making texas, and our country, a safer place. additional photos are available on the dps facebook page. ### (hq 2022-055)  @txdps @txdps \u00a0 txdeptpublicsafety texas dps mobile app phone: (512) 424-2080 email:
