environmental protection agency\u2019s (epa) plan that could jeopardize a quarter of the nation\u2019s gas supply. the epa recently announced it may impose a discretionary re-designation of the permian basin, which accounts for approximately 40% of all oil produced in the u.s. if allowed to proceed, the epa\u2019s actions in the permian basin could result in draconian regulations that would directly interfere with the nation\u2019s most prolific oil field. \u201cwhile you express concern about out-of-control gas prices, your environmental protection agency (epa) is threatening to increase them even further,\u201d reads the letter. \u201cthe epa\u2019s process could interfere in the production of oil in texas which could lead to skyrocketing prices at the pump by reducing production, increase the cost of that production, or do both. your administration's announced action is completely discretionary. thus, you have the power to stop it. if you do not, this action alone might serve as a catalyst for economic harm leading to an even deeper reliance on imported foreign energy and a faster economic decline into the pending recession by forcing even more pain for american consumers to pay at the pump.\u201d according to u.s. energy information administration data, permian basin producers in texas and new mexico are responsible for 5.2 million barrels of oil per day, which can be processed into about 95 million gallons of gasoline a day. the letter points out that not only would the epa\u2019s re-designation process lead to higher gas prices for americans by disrupting roughly 25% of the u.s. oil supply, but it puts at risk hundreds of thousands of good-paying energy jobs. the texas oil and gas industry directly employs more than 422,000 texans and supports 1.37 million total direct and indirect texas jobs. governor abbott's letter also requests a response from the biden administration by july 29, 2022. if the epa's proposed re-designation is not suspended, the state of texas will take action necessary to protect the production of oil. a week after president biden was sworn in last january, governor abbott issued an executive order to protect texas\u2019 energy industry from federal overreach following a roundtable in odessa with energy workers, leaders, and advocates. the executive order directed every state agency to use all

and school districts across the state. to achieve that goal, i am directing dps, tea, and thecb to enhance and expedite your efforts to make widely known and easily accessible the ability to report
